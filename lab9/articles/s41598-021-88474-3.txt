Relationship between markers of inflammation and hemodynamic stress and death in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
Biomarkers that reflect hemodynamic stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction may improve risk stratification and add valuable pathobiological insight in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In total, 120 patients with OHCA who survived at least 48 h after return of spontaneous circulation were consecutively included in the present analysis. Concentrations of 30 biomarkers were measured simultaneously using a multi-panel biomarker assay. Cox regression models were adjusted for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, lactate concentration, bystander resuscitation, initial cardiac rhythm, and type of targeted temperature management. Overall, 57 patients (47.5%) had a favorable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category ≤ 2) at 30 days, while palliative care was initiated in 49 patients (40.8%), and 52 patients (43.3%) died. After correction for multiple testing with Bonferroni-Holm, 8 biomarkers (including Angiopoietin-2, Procalcitonin, Resistin, IL-4Rα, MMP-8, TNFα, Renin, and IL-1α) were significantly associated with all-cause death. After multivariable adjustment, only angiopoietin-2 (Adjusted (Adj) hazard ratio (HR) per 1-unit increase in standardized biomarker concentrations 1.52 (95% CI 1.16–1.99)) and renin (Adj HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.06–1.65) remained independently associated with an increased risk of death. The discriminatory performance indicated good performance for angiopoietin-2 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.75 (95% CI 0.66–0.75) and was significantly higher (P = 0.011) as compared with renin (AUC: 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.60). In conclusion, angiopoietin-2 was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in patients with OHCA who survived the first 48 h and may prove to be useful for risk stratification of these patients.
Despite significant advances in post-cardiac arrest management over the last decades, including implementation of targeted temperature management1 (TTM) and the proposal of specialized centers for post-cardiac arrest patients2, outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after return-of-spontaneous circulation (ROSC) remain poor3. Regardless of the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest (CA), these patients are at high risk of developing severe complications leading to multi-organ failure and death due to myocardial dysfunction, systemic inflammatory and ischemic/reperfusion response, and anoxic brain injury4. In addition to determining the cause of CA and implementing disease-specific interventions, mitigation of these risks remains imperative. This complex syndrome, which has been termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome, is characterized by several different pathophysiological processes, including hemodynamic stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Although some markers of hemodynamic stress have been found to be associated with an increased risk of death in patients with cardiac arrest5,6, surrogate markers of inflammation and of endothelial function and structure have been less well studied. With this variety of pathobiological pathways involved, we hypothesized that a panel of biomarkers that reflect hemodynamic stress, inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction might improve risk stratification and add valuable pathobiological insight. Mortality due to hemodynamic compromise and withdrawal of care dominates mechanisms of early post-cardiac arrest mortality, while other underlying pathophysiologic processes, including septic shock, are more likely to occur later. Consequently, we aimed to study a multi-biomarker panel reflecting different pathways in patients with OHCA and ROSC who survived at least 48 h.
Among 383 patients who were admitted between 26 May 2013 and 27 June 2017, 120 patients were identified to meet the inclusion criteria and included in the present study (Supplemental Fig. 1). The median observation time was 26 days (interquartile range (IQR) 10 – 373 days)and the median follow-up time using the reverse KM estimator was 354 days (IQR 97–684 days). The patients’ median age was 64.5 years, and 29 patients (24.2%) were female. Eighty-three patients (69.2%) received bystander-initiated CPR (Table 1). The majority of patients had shockable rhythm as the first monitored heart rhythm (n = 73, 59.8%) and a presumed cardiac etiology (n = 90, 75%) as the cause of cardiac arrest.
Overall, 57 patients (47.5%) had a favorable neurological outcome (CPC ≤ 2) at 30 days, while palliative care was initiated in 49 patients (40.8%), and 52 patients (43.3%) died. Patients who died were more likely to be older, male, and have a higher SAPS II score on admission but had a lower eGFR (Supplemental Table 1).
The median biomarker levels measured at 48 h in patients with OHCA and the correlation matrix are shown in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. Levels of all biomarkers, except those of IL-9 and PlGF, differed significantly between deceased and survived patients with OHCA, and an apparently healthy patient population (Supplemental Fig. 2, Supplemental Table 2).
After correction for multiple testing with Bonferroni-Holm, eight biomarkers were significantly associated with all-cause death in unadjusted Cox regression models (Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) per 1-unit increase in standardized biomarker concentrations: Angiopoietin-2: HR 1.79 (95% CI 1.46–2.19), IL-4Rα: HR 1.52 (95% CI 1.27–1.83), MMP-8: HR 1.36 (95% CI 1.15–1.61), Procalcitonin: HR 1.73 (95% CI 1.38–2.18), Renin: HR 1.36 (95% CI 1.12–1.64), and IL-1α: HR 1.29 (95% CI 1.10–1.52), Resistin: HR 2.09 (95% CI 1.54–2.84), TNFα: HR 1.29 (95% CI 1.11–1.49); Supplemental Table 3). Similar findings were observed for biomarker levels on admission (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6), but neither biomarker concentrations on admission nor change in biomarker levels were significantly associated with death when added to biomarkers measured at 48 h.
After multivariable adjustment, only angiopoietin-2 (Adjusted (Adj) HR per 1-unit increase in standardized biomarker concentrations 1.46 (95% CI 1.10–1.95)) and renin (Adj HR per 1-unit increase in standardized biomarker concentrations 1.35 (95% CI 1.08–1.69) remained independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (Fig. 1). This relationship remained virtually identical after further adjustment for patients’ baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) score (Supplemental Fig. 3) and baseline high-sensitivity troponin T and baseline high-sensitivity CRP (Supplemental Fig. 4). The Kaplan Meier curves separated early (< 5 days) for angiopoetin-2 (Fig. 2A) while for renin (Fig. 2B) the division occurred delayed after nearly 2 weeks. The event rates stratified by the median of both angiopoietin-2 and renin indicated angiopoietin-2 to be of complementary nature for renin (both Logrank P values < 0.01) but not vice versa (both Logrank P values > 0.10) (Fig. 3). In a bivariable model of angiopoietin-2 and renin, as well as in the multivariable adjusted model including the full set of covariates, only angiopoietin-2 remained statistically significant. Angiopoietin-2 modeled with adjusted natural smoothed regression splines, indicated a consistent nearly linear increase in the hazard for all-cause death from 1.5 to 40 pg/ml of biomarker concentrations (Fig. 4). Moreover, both biomarkers angiopoietin-2 and renin were significantly associated with worse CPC score (angiopoietin-2: odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% CI 1.25–6.13; renin: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.28–4.67).

The models were adjusted for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate at 48 h, lactate levels at 48 h, bystander resuscitation, presence of shockable rhythm as the first monitored heart rhythm, and type of targeted temperature management (33° versus 36°Celsius).

The discriminatory performance indicated good performance for angiopoietin-2 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.75 (95% CI 0.66–0.75) and was significantly higher (Δ 0.15, P = 0.011) compared with the AUC for renin (AUC: 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.60; Table 2). The addition of the two biomarkers to the clinical covariates used for adjustment and the baseline SAPS II score resulted in a numerical but non-significant improvement of the AUC for the discrimination of death (AUC 0.94 versus 0.91, Δ = 0.03, P value 0.12).
The association between angiopoietin-2 and renin, respectively, and the risk of death was consistent (P-interaction > 0.10) across different tested subgroups, including the presence of bystander resuscitation, presumed etiology of cardiac arrest, type of first monitored ECG rhythm, and type of targeted temperature management. However, there was a significant interaction (P value for interaction 0.046) for renin based on the type of first monitored ECG rhythm. The association tended to be stronger in patients with shockable rhythm (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.29–2.33) as compared with patients with non-shockable ECG (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.87–1.52; P value for interaction 0.046). Otherwise, there were no subgroup differences for renin.
In this study examining a panel of multiple novel and clinically established biomarkers, angiopoietin-2 emerged as a biomarker that was strongly associated with all-cause mortality in patients with OHCA.
Early risk stratification and neurological prognostication of patients with OHCA remains challenging. Clinical examination and electrophysiological measurements are impeded by sedation during targeted temperature management. Therefore, biomarkers can be helpful tools that provide diagnostic and/or prognostic information and give insight into pathobiological mechanisms in this early phase of treatment. In patients with OHCA, multiple pathophysiological processes are involved in the postcardiac arrest phase. Critical hemodynamic stress often manifests and offers a profound challenge predominantly in the early post-cardiac arrest period, while inflammatory processes may occur with some delay. The restoration of blood flow to all organs is followed by a global ischemia–reperfusion insult that promotes systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Shock further enhances proinflammatory cytokines that lead to inappropriate vasodilation, impaired vascular barrier function, and capillary leakage with direct cellular damage and edema. However, hemodynamic impairment and inflammation may alternate or coincide.
The tested biomarker panel reflects several critical pathophysiological processes present in patients after ROSC, including hemodynamic stress, inflammation, and vascular integrity. In the current analysis, angiopoietin-2 emerged as a possibly valuable risk marker. Angiopoietin-2 had the highest discriminatory performance among the tested biomarkers. Although the effects of angiopoietin-2 are context-dependent and may exert even opposite effects depending on the hormonal milieu, the angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand-receptor system has been shown to play an essential role in the endothelial barrier function13,14. As a marker of vascular integrity, angiopoietin-2 may therefore be associated with the presence of edema reflecting conditions with unfavorable prognosis such as capillary leak syndrome or edema of the brain in post-cardiac arrest patients. In addition to its pro-angiogenetic properties, angiopoietin-2 has also been implicated in inflammatory processes15. Previous studies have shown higher angiopoietin-2 concentrations in patients with decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock16,17,18. Furthermore, angiopoietin-2 levels have been found to be increased in patients with sepsis19 and a mendelian randomization analysis suggested a possible causal role of plasma angiopoietin-2 in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome20. These data, therefore, add to the growing body of evidence that angiopoietin-2 may have pathophysiological relevance and a prognostic role in critically ill patients.
Several limitations should be addressed: The sample size is limited, and patients were only recruited at one center. Moreover, generalizability is limited as only OHCA patients who survived the first 48 h were included in this study. The addition of angiopoietin-2 and renin did not result in a significant improvement of risk discrimination compared with a comprehensive clinical model, though it is important to note that the comparisons of very well-performing models are low-power procedures. Furthermore, we did not assess the specific cause of death. Also, other important established biomarkers, including hsCRP and high-sensitivity troponin T were only measured on admission but not at 48 h.
Although these findings require external validation, the present data add to the growing body of evidence that employment of biomarkers can be helpful to improve risk stratification in patients with OHCA. Future research should focus on the clinical utility of multimarker approaches that reflect different pathophysiological pathways, the development and validation of easy implementable risk scores, and address whether biomarker-based interventions or targeting the angiopoietin-2/renin pathway reduce clinical outcomes.
