Bohr’s complementarity is one central tenet of quantum physics. The paradoxical wave-particle duality of quantum matters and photons has been tested in Young’s double-slit (double-path) interferometers. The object exclusively exhibits wave and particle nature, depending measurement apparatus that can be delayed chosen to rule out too-naive interpretations of quantum complementarity. All experiments to date have been implemented in the double-path framework, while it is of fundamental interest to study complementarity in multipath interferometric systems. Here, we demonstrate generalized multipath wave-particle duality in a quantum delayed-choice experiment, implemented by large-scale silicon-integrated multipath interferometers. Single-photon displays sophisticated transitions between wave and particle characters, determined by the choice of quantum-controlled generalized Hadamard operations. We characterise particle-nature by multimode which-path information and wave-nature by multipath coherence of interference, and demonstrate the generalisation of Bohr’s multipath duality relation. Our work provides deep insights into multidimensional quantum physics and benchmarks controllability of integrated photonic quantum technology.
Famous double-slit or double-path experiments, implemented in a Young’s or Mach–Zehnder interferometer, have confirmed the dual nature of quantum matters1. When a stream of photons2, neutrons3, atoms4, or molecules5, passes through two narrow slits, either wave-like interference fringes build up on a screen, or particle-like which-path distribution can be ascertained. These quantum objects exhibit both wave and particle properties but exclusively, depending on the way they are measured1. In the equivalent Mach–Zehnder configuration, quantum objects display either wave or particle nature in the presence or absence of a beamsplitter, respectively, where the beamsplitter represents the choice of measurement apparatus6. Wheeler further proposed a Gedanken experiment7, in which the choice of particle or interference measurement is made after the object has already entered the interferometer, so as to exclude the possibility of predicting with which measurement it will be confronted. Delayed-choice experiments have enabled significant demonstrations of the genuine two-path duality of different quantum objects8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. Moreover, a quantitative description of two-slit duality relation was initialized in Wootters and Zurek’s seminal work6 and then formalized by Greenberger, Yasin, Jaeger, and Englert16,17,18 as \({{\mathcal{D}}}^{2}+{{\mathcal{V}}}^{2}\le 1\), where \({\mathcal{D}}\) is the distinguishability of which-path information (a measure of particle-property), and \({\mathcal{V}}\) is the contrast visibility of interference (a measure of wave-property). This double-path duality relation has been tested in pioneer experiments19 and in delayed-choice measurements11,13.
Since the birth of quantum mechanics, it has long been of fundamental interests to understand multipath interference of quantum mechanical wavefunction in complex quantum systems20,21,22,23,24,25. Quantum nature represented as the principles of complementarity and superposition however remains ambiguous in multipath interferometric quantum systems17,26,27,28,29,30. Figure 1a sketches a general multipath Mach–Zehnder interferometric delayed-choice experiment with a single photon. Whether the photons take one or multiple paths to a given detector depends on the absence or presence of the second d-mode beamsplitter. In a delayed-choice experiment, the photons can either take all d paths simultaneously (multipath wave character), or one of the d paths (multimode particle character), or everything in between, determined in a delayed manner by the choice of the d-mode particle measurement or interference measurement. In contrast to the double-slit implementation, the duality relation well describes the wave-particle complementarity, however, it cannot be simply generalized in the multipath experiment26,27,28,29,30. There are several major open questions remaining: Can Bohr’s duality relation still hold in the multipath interferometric experiment? Are there any good measures of multipath wave and multimode particle properties that are accessible in experiment? Does single photon preserve the inherent dual nature in the multipath delayed-choice scenario? Revealing these unknowns are essential to understand multimode quantum superposition and quantization in complex quantum systems. Apart from fundamental interests, the characterization of multimode quantum properties in controllable systems may provide the ground of developing multidimensional quantum technology31. For example, quantifying multimode coherence from sophisticated multipath interference patterns is of practical significance32, in the light of recent reassessment of coherence as a key resource in quantum information33,34, while it has always been a core concept underlying the theory of quantum mechanics. In general, when single photons pass through multiple paths, a superposition of multiple modes naturally forms a qudit state. Promising prospects of qudit-based quantum applications have been well acknowledged, such as noise-robust multidimensional entanglement35,36, resource-efficient quantum computations, and simulations37,38, and high-capacity quantum communications39,40; however, the deep understanding of the most elementary physics of multidimensional quantum systems is highly demanded. Any explorations of multidimensional quantum science and technology strongly rely on the quantum platform that can be operated with high-level controllability, efficiency, and versatility31. It is here the integrated-optics implementation provides one of the most competitive multidimensional quantum platforms41.

The d-BSs can implement the generalized Hadamard operator \({\hat{H}}_{d}\). c, d Quantum circuit representation. The state of \({\hat{H}}_{d}\) operator is entangled with the state of a control qubit \({\left|\psi \right\rangle }_{C}\). Our target is to quantify the wave-particle dual nature of a maximal coherent state \({\rho }_{0}={\left|{{\Psi }}\right\rangle }_{00}\left\langle {{\Psi }}\right|\) by the delayed choice of measurement \({\hat{\text{M}}}_{m}\). \({\hat{\text{M}}}_{m}\) represents the d-mode particle or interference measurement (m is the measurement setting). e Simplified schematic, and f optical microscope image of the chip. The chip monolithically integrates an entangled photon-pair source, a d-path MZI, a quantum-controlled d-BS, and a d-mode eraser (note detectors are off chip). A pair of path-entangled photons (orange signal, blue idler photons) are generated in the integrated SFWM sources (dashed box). The target photon is sent through the d-MZI, undergoing either a d-mode wave process (bottom red circuits) or d-mode particle process (upper green circuits). If the control photon takes \(\left|0\right\rangle\), the target undergoes the particle-process; if the control takes \(\left|1\right\rangle\), the target undergoes the wave process; if the control is in a superposition state, the target undergoes the two processes coherently. A d-mode eraser ensures quantum indistinguishability between the two processes, see the zoom-in view in the inset. These result in the generalized quantum-controlled \({\hat{H}}_{d}\) or d-BS2. That being said, either wave or particle measurement \({\hat{\text{M}}}_{m}\) the photon takes is decided by the state of d-BS2, crucially, that is entangled with the control photon {α, δ}. Arbitrary {θd, α, δ} can be chosen on the chip. The integrated d-BSs are fully reconfigurable. The chip integrates 95 phase-shifters (golden lines), 158 beamsplitters, 58 waveguide crossers, 42 grating couplers, and 2 SFWM sources, in total 355 components (partially shown for clarity), among one of the largest quantum photonic devices.

Here, we report a quantum delayed-choice multipath experiment and demonstrate a generalization of wave-particle duality relation. The wave-particle nature of single photons propagating in a d-path (d up to 8) interferometer is observed, determined in a delayed manner by the state of a d-mode quantum-controlled beamsplitter. Qualitative wave-particle transitions having a 0.99 fidelity of theoretical and experimental results, and quantitative multipath duality relation are both confirmed in the context of delayed-choice. We show that quantum coherence is a good measure of the wave-property in d-path interference, and the amount of coherence can be directly probed from interference patterns, without accessing the density matrix. The d-mode which-path information is identified, and quantum randomness is efficiently generated. All demonstrations are enabled by realizing a multipath delayed-choice interferometric system on a large-scale silicon nanophotonic quantum chip that monolithically integrates 355 optical components and 95 phase-shifters.
Wave-particle duality is a fundamental feature of quantum physics. The sophisticated d-path interference patterns in fact contain rich information. For example, a direct quantification of the amount of coherence embedded in the d-path interference patterns is allowed by measuring the visibility \({{\mathcal{V}}}_{d}\) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 6), without the need for explicitly referring to the ρ of the system. We measured the l1-norm coherence (see refs. 33,34) \({\widetilde{{\mathcal{C}}}}_{l1}\) for d ∈ [2, 8], directly from the d-path full-wave interference fringes (α = π). Figure 5a shows the results that identify a linear scale-up of \({\widetilde{{\mathcal{C}}}}_{l1}\) information. In addition, the which-path information of d-outcomes is fundamentally non-deterministic and provides a way for quantum randomness generation. Based on the d-mode quantizations, it is possible to generate more than one bit of randomness35,47,48. The randomness is quantified by min-entropy \({H}_{\min }=-{{\rm{log}}}_{2}{p}_{d}\), where pd is the probability of correctly guessing which path the photons take. Figure 5b shows the measured \({H}_{\min }\) values, in the full-particle case (α = 0), generating more than one bit of randomness.
a Quantification of the l1-norm quantum coherence \({\tilde{{\mathcal{C}}}}_{l1}\) from the d-path full-wave interference patterns when α is chosen as π. The \({\widetilde{{\mathcal{C}}}}_{l1}\) values are estimated from the visibility by \({{\mathcal{V}}}_{d}(d-1)\), that are directly probed from the d-path interference patterns, without accessing the full density matrix. b Measurement of quantum randomness entropy \({H}_{\min }\) from the d-mode full-particle quantized distributions, when α is chosen as zero. More than one bit of randomness is obtained. The results in a and b are collected in the quantum wave-particle superposition measurement. Red points represent experimental data, while orange lines represent theoretical results. Error bars (±σ) are estimated from photon Poissonian statistics.
Imperfect device fabrication and noisy operation ultimately contribute to the degradation of our experiment results, such as an accuracy of 10−3 of the bound for the high-order interference, and noises in the measurements of generalized wave-particle transition and duality relation. For example, photon leakages between neighboring paths in the d-MZI, owning to the presence of thermal crosstalks and imperfect extinction ratio of 2-MZIs (~30 dB), bring in noises in the measurement of high-order interference. Further optimizations of device fabrication and alleviations of crosstalk can improve the performance. Moreover, accidental counts may be induced from the undesirable SFWM process when the residual bright light propagates through the whole chip, i.e., the parts after the sources, though they are negligible in the measurement of coincidences. Such background noises can be further suppressed by the adoptions of pump rejection filter49 and optical microresonator photon-pair source with a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio50. In our experiment, we relied on the assumptions that photons were faithfully sampled, and the choice-maker and the observer were independent from each other; these assumptions could be further relaxed in future51.
In conclusion, we have reported an experimental generalization of Bohr’s duality relation in a delayed-choice experiment, on a large-scale silicon-integrated quantum optical chip. The multipath wave-particle transition and generalized duality relation have now been confirmed by the delayed choice of measurement performed on single photons. Such a multimode quantum system provides a versatile platform to study multimode quantum superposition and coherence—the most fundamental quantum properties and resources33. The direct probing of quantum coherence from interference distributions may allow the study of quantum processes and dynamics in complex quantum physical systems52 and biological systems53. Going beyond the qubit-based quantum systems, highly controllable multidimensional quantum devices and systems that bases on the large-scale integrated quantum photonics platform are expected to continuously advance quantum information science and technologies41,54,55.
The large-scale integrated quantum photonic device for the implementation of the multipath delayed-choice experiment was designed and fabricated on the silicon nanophotonics platform, a versatile system for photonic quantum information technologies. The quantum device was fabricated by the standard CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) processes. A layer of photoresist was the first spin on an 8-inch SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer with 220-nm-thick top silicon and 3 μm-thick buried oxide. The 248 nm DUV (deep ultraviolet) lithography was adopted to define the circuit patterns on the photoresist. Double inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching processes were applied to transfer the patterns from the photoresist layer to the silicon layer, forming waveguides and circuits. Deep etching waveguides (see SEM image in Fig. 1g) with an etched depth of 220 nm were used for the SFWM photon sources, beamsplitters, and phase-shifters. Shallow etching waveguides (see SEM image in Fig. 1h) with an etched depth of 70 nm were used for the waveguide crossers and grating couplers. A SiO2 layer of 1μm thickness was deposited on top of the SOI wafer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), working as an isolation layer between the waveguides and metal heaters to avoid potential optical losses. Then, a 10-nm-thick Ti glue layer, a 20-nm-thick TiN barrier layer, an 800-nm-thick AlCu layer, and a 20-nm-thick TiN anti-reflective layer, were consequently deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) and patterned by DUV lithography and etching process to form the electrode. A 50-nm-thick TiN layer for thermal-optical phase-shifters was deposited and also patterned by DUV lithography and etching process. Finally, another 1-μm-thick SiO2 was deposited as the top cladding layer, and followed by the bonding pad opening process. More SEM images of the fabricated optical components and their characterizations are provided in Supplementary Note 1.
Our experimental setup bases on off-the-shelf telecommunication instruments. A tunable continuous-wave laser (EXFO) central at a wavelength of 1550.11 nm was amplified to 40 mW by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA, Pritel), and then fed in to the silicon-photonics quantum chip as a pump source for the SFWM nonlinear process. Before the chip, the polarization state of the pump light was optimized by a fiber polatisation controller in order to excite the transverse electric (TE) mode of silicon waveguides. A pair of path-coded entangled photons was on-chip generated by the two SFMW sources (Fig. 1), and further adopted for the implementation of multipath quantum delayed-choice experiment. We selected the signal photon at 1545.31 nm and idler photon at 1554.91 nm. After the chip, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) filters with a bandwidth of 1.1 nm and 200 GHz channel spacing were used to remove the residual pump light. Single photons were detected by an array of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs, Photonspot). A multichannel time interval analyzer (Swabian) was used to record two-fold photon coincidences. All of the 95 thermal-optical phase-shifters were accessed and controlled individually by multichannel electronics (Qontrol) with a 16-bits precision and KHz speed. The quantum chip was glued on a printed circuit board (PCB), and packaged by wire bonding (Fig. 1f). To achieve the full 2π operation of each phase-shifter, it requires about 40 mW power consumption. When all phase-shifters were on, total power consumption was about several watts. To ensure the stability of quantum operations and suppress thermal noises and thermal crosstalk, the chip was mounted on a Peltier-cell and a thermosink with liquid cooling in order to dissipate power rapidly and efficiently. A thermistor mounted on the chip together with a proportional integrative derivative controller was used to monitor and stabilize the temperature of the photonic device. See Supplementary Fig. 2 for more experimental details.
