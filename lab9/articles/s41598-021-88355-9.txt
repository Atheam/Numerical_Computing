Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a high-risk subtype of breast cancer with high capacity for metastasis and lacking of therapeutic targets. Our previous studies indicated that cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) may be a new target related to the recurrence or metastasis of TNBC. Downregulation of CSE could inhibit the growth and metastasis of TNBC. The purpose of this study was to investigate the activity of the novel CSE inhibitor I194496 against TNBC in vivo and in vitro. The anticancer activity of I194496 in vitro were detected by MTS, EdU, and transwell assays. Methylene blue assay was used to determine the H2S level. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of related pathway proteins. Xenograft tumors in nude mice were used to analyze the anticancer activity of I194496 in vivo. I194496 exerted potent inhibitory effects than l-propargylglycine (PAG, an existing CSE inhibitor) on human TNBC cells and possessed lower toxicity in normal breast epithelial Hs578Bst cells. I194496 reduced the activity and expression of CSE protein and the release of H2S in human TNBC cells. Meanwhile, the protein levels of PI3K, Akt, phospho (p)-Akt, Ras, Raf, p-ERK, p-Anxa2, STAT3, p-STAT3, VEGF, FAK, and Paxillin were decreased in human TNBC cells administrated with I194496. Furthermore, I194496 showed more stronger inhibitory effects on human TNBC xenograft tumors in nude mice. I194496 could inhibit the growth of human TNBC cells via the dual targeting PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK pathway and suppress the metastasis of human TNBC cells via down-regulating Anxa2/STAT3 and VEGF/FAK/Paxillin signaling pathways. CSE inhibitor I194496 might become a novel and potential agent in the treatment of TNBC.
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with the highest metastatic rate and the lowest overall survival rate1,2,3. Moreover, TNBC is hard to target treatment due to the lack of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). At present, the only available strategy for TNBC is still challenging the chemical treatment4. However it is limited by the toxicity and multi-drug resistance of chemotherapy drugs5. Consequently, an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC is crying need.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third gaseous signaling molecule, along with nitric oxide6,7,8,9,10 and carbon monoxide11,12, not only functions in numerous physiological and developmental processes, but also serves important roles in cancer13,14. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) is an endogenous enzyme that produces H2S. Researches have shown that endogenous H2S produced by CSE could promote the growth of human tumor cells15,16,17. Our previous studies indicated that the high-expression of CSE protein promoted the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells18,19. Therefore, CSE may be a new target for the metastasis of TNBC. The research on inhibitors targeting CSE will be of great significance for the treatment of TNBC.
I194496, a new inhibitor targeting CSE protein, was obtained through virtual screening according to the crystal structure of CSE protein by our research group. In this study, we firstly in vitro determined the roles of I194496 in human TNBC. We then detected the effects of I194496 on tumor growth in nude mice bearing human TNBC xenografts. This study will make it possible to find new ways in how to get to target therapy of TNBC and how to overcome the recurrence or metastasis of TNBC.
I194496 is a CSE inhibitor obtained by virtual screening based on the crystal structure of CSE protein, as described in our previous paper20. To confirm the inhibitory effect of I194496 on CSE, we firstly examined the direct inhibition of CSE by I194496 using the recombinant CSE protein and observed that I194496 possessed significant inhibitory activity against CSE protein with IC50 of 0.79 mM (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Then we detected the effect of I194496 on CSE protein concentration in breast cancer cells using the human CSE ELISA kit (Camilo Biological. Inc., Nanjing, China). The results showed that I194496 distinctly reduced the concentrations of CSE protein of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A,B). Then we further confirmed the inhibitory effect of I194496 on CSE protein activity by the investigation of the production of H2S, and we found that I194496 significantly inhibited production of H2S in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2C,D). In addition, we also found that I194496 significantly decreased the protein and mRNA levels of CSE (Fig. 2E–H and Supplementary Fig. 1) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but I194496 did not affect the expression of CBS protein (Supplementary Fig. 2E–H) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The data together indicate that I194496 specifically suppresses the CSE/H2S system of TNBC cells. But PAG at the 40 μM concentration had no effect on the production of H2S and the concentrations of CSE protein as well as the expression level of CSE protein in TNBC cells (Fig. 2A–D and Supplementary Fig. 2A–D).

MTS results showed that I194496 significantly decreased the viability of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549 and HCC1937 cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control and PAG group (Fig. 3A,B and Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of I194496 in normal breast epithelial cells Hs578Bst was lower than that in breast cancer cells (Fig. 3C,D and Supplementary Fig. 3). In the EdU assay, I194496 could markedly decrease the number of EdU+ MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549 and HCC1937 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E,F and Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, the inhibitory activities of I194496 on cell migration and invasion were also observed in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 4A–C), MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 4D–F), BT-549 and HCC1937 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that I194496 possesses the capacity of inhibiting the growth, proliferation, migration and invasion of human TNBC cells.

The PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are commonly dysregulated in breast cancer and activated in TNBC24,25. Endogenous or exogenous H2S can play their roles by regulating one or both of these pathways26,27. In this study, we found that I194496 decreased the levels of PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt proteins in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5A–D). Interestingly, we also observed the decreased protein levels of Ras, Raf, and p-ERK in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells administrated with I194496 (Fig. 5E–H). These data suggest that 194496 may exert anticancer activity by dual targeting of the PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway in human TNBC cells.

Overexpression of Annexin A2 (Anxa2) is positively correlated with the progression of breast cancer28. Moreover, Anxa2 could activate STATS by directly bingding to STAT3, and consequently involve in the invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells29. VEGF is highly expressed in breast cancer cells and VEGF/FAK/Paxillin pathway contributes to the metastasis of breast cancer19. Our previous studies have shown that CSE/H2S system can promote process and metastasis of breast cancer via the STAT3 signaling pathway and VEGF signaling pathway18,19. In this study, we found I194496 decreased the protein levels of p-Anxa2, STAT3, and p-STAT3 in the MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 6A,B) and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 6C,D). Meanwhile, the decreased protein levels of VEGF, FAK, and Paxillin were also observed in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells administrated with I194496 (Fig. 6E–H). These data implied that I194496 may inhibit metastasis by targeting Anxa2/STAT3 and VEGF/FAK/Paxillin signaling pathways in human TNBC cells.

In this part, the effect of I194496 on the growth of TNBC xenograft tumors was investigated. I194496 inhibited the growth of TNBC xenograft tumors compared with the control and PAG group (Fig. 7A–E), but I194496 did not affect the body weight (Fig. 7F). IHC with the CSE antibody confirmed that the in vivo inhibitory effect of I194496 on CSE protein (Fig. 8A–C). Western blot with the CSE antibody further confirmed that the in vivo inhibitory effect of I194496 on CSE protein (Fig. 8D–G). Western blot with the VEGF antibody indicated the possible in vivo inhibitory effect of I194496 on angiogenesis. The data suggest that I194496 may possess the ability of inhibiting the growth and angiogenesis of human TNBC xenograft tumors.

Many works have been performed to obtain new predictive markers and therapeutic targets for the TNBC30,31,32,33. In our previous study, we found that CSE, an endogenous H2S synthase, promoted the progression of breast cancer18 and the metastasis of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells19. As a consequence, CSE could be a new therapeutic target in TNBC, and then the study of the inhibitors targeting CSE protein may be of great significance for TNBC.
In this research, we explored the action and mechanism of a new CSE inhibitor I194496 obtaining by virtual screening according to the crystal structure of CSE protein by our research group in the early stage, in TNBC. The data of activity analysis of CSE recombinant protein, CSE ELISA and H2S production were integrated to our analysis to provide support to the new compound I194496 as CSE inhibitor. CSE mRNA and protein levels and H2S production were shown to be distinctly reduced in TNBC cells administrated with I194496. Subsequently, we researched the actions of I194496 in four TNBC cell lines by MTS, EdU and transwell assays and observed that I194496 significantly decreased the cell viability, the number of EdU+ cells as well as the number of migration and invasion in four TNBC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It is thus clear that the new CSE inhibitor I194496 could effectively inhibit the growth, proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells. The combined data enhanced our occasions of discerning CSE inhibitor I194496 with real potential to become new therapeutic agent for TNBC.
Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of I194496 against TNBC were explored to give further support to I194496 as a new therapeutic agent. Cell survival and cell proliferation in human breast cancers are associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway or the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway24,25. It was found that inhibition of one of the two pathways can still result in the maintenance of the other pathway. So the dual targeting of the two pathways may lead to superior efficacy and better clinical outcome in selected patients. H2S exhibits the function of activating the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways34. Moreover, it is reported that H2S regulates the growth of human breast cancer cells or thyroid carcinoma cells through PI3K/Akt/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways27,35. In our present study, we observed that both PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathways were blocked by I194496 in human TNBC cells, which indicated that I194496 could depress growth and proliferation of TNBC cells through dual targeting the PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathways via inhibiting the release of H2S by CSE.
High-expression of Anxa2 could directly regulate STAT3 and consequently enhance the invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells28,29. We here found I194496 decreased the protein levels of p-Anxa2 and p-STAT3, which suggested that the inhibition of Anxa 2/STAT3 pathway may be a way for I194496 to control metastasis of TNBC. VEGF/FAK/Paxillin pathway contributes to the metastasis of breast cancer19. Our previous research suggested that CSE expression regulated VEGF expression in MDA-MB-231(19). In this research, VEGF/FAK/Paxillin pathway was inhibited by I194496 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. It follows that the downregulation of VEGF/FAK/Paxillin pathway could be another way for I194496 to inhibit metastasis of TNBC.
Finally, we determined the effects of I194496 on the growth of TNBC xenograft tumors in nude mice. I194496 possessed more strong inhibitory effect on the growth of human TNBC xenograft tumors compared with PAG group. But I194496 did not affect the body weight of mice bearing tumor. Moreover, our data proved that I194496 decreased the level of CSE and VEGF protein in TNBC xenograft tumors. The results indicated that the novel CSE inhibitor could possess more potent anticancer effects through the inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis in TNBC xenograft tumors.
In conclusion, the novel CSE inhibitor I194496 could restrain the growth of human TNBC cells by dual targeting the PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathways and also could inhibit the metastasis of human TNBC cells by inhibiting the Anxa2/STAT3 and VEGF/FAK/Paxillin signaling pathways, as shown in Fig. 9. CSE inhibitors might be of novel and potential agents in the treatment of breast cancer.
