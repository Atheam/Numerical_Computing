Cardioprotective effects of empagliflozin after ischemia and reperfusion in rats
The Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), reduces mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure following myocardial infarction irrespective of diabetes status. While the findings suggest an inherent cardioprotective capacity, the mechanism remains unknown. We studied infarct size (IS) ex-vivo in isolated hearts exposed to global IR injury and in-vivo in rats subjected to regional myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, in whom we followed left ventricular dysfunction for 28 days. We compared rats that were given EMPA orally for 7 days before, EMPA 1.5 h before IR injury and at onset of reperfusion and continued orally during the follow-up period. We used echocardiography, high resolution respirometry, microdialysis and plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate to assess myocardial performance, mitochondrial respiration and intermediary metabolism, respectively. Pretreatment with EMPA for 7 days reduced IS in-vivo (65 ± 7% vs. 46 ± 8%, p < 0.0001 while administration 1.5 h before IR, at onset of reperfusion or ex-vivo did not. EMPA alleviated LV dysfunction irrespective of the reduction in IS. EMPA improved mitochondrial respiration and modulated myocardial interstitial metabolism while the concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid was only transiently increased without any association with IS reduction. EMPA reduces infarct size and yields cardioprotection in non-diabetic rats with ischemic LV dysfunction by an indirect, delayed intrinsic mechanism that also improves systolic function beyond infarct size reduction. The mechanism involves enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and modulated myocardial metabolism but not hyperketonemia.
Although mortality from acute MI has declined over the last 25 years1,2, long-term mortality, i.e. 1 year and beyond, and post-MI heart failure is still significant1,3. The disarrays that may lead to deterioration of left ventricular (LV) contractile function are determined by the extent of myocardial damage caused by MI4. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial and involve not only complex remodeling at the organ level but also neurohormonal changes to compensate for the lack of contractile function5.
Recent groundbreaking clinical studies have shown that treatment with Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors markedly reduced cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF6,7,8,9. The reduction was independent of diabetic status8,9. While originally intended as a glucose-lowering alternative to metformin for patients with type II diabetes mellitus, contemporary discoveries indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors have a class effect on HF in individuals surviving an acute MI, whereas the incidence of recurrent MI is unchanged. The mechanisms underlying these observations are unknown.
Supporting the clinical findings, a recent experimental study demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, has a cardioprotective capability by reducing infarct size in an in vivo rat model of ischemia reperfusion (IR) independently not only of circulating glucose but also circulating ketone levels10 that are known to be increased by SGLT2 inhibitor treatment11. Despite absent infarct size reduction in an in vitro rat heart model, another SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), improves post-MI mitochondrial respiration and increases inner membrane permeability in non-diabetic rats12. The ischemic myocardium is characterized by suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which may be further deranged by reperfusion13. We hypothesized that cardioprotection by SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with improved mitochondrial respiration. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of EMPA on IS and cardiac and mitochondrial function after IR induced chronic ventricular dysfunction and after acute IR injury in an in vivo rat heart model.
In the in vivo infarct size study, we included 66 rats. Numbers for the final analysis and those excluded are shown in the flow chart in supplementary figure S1a. In the ex vivo infarct size series, we included 20 animals. Two rats were excluded due to protocol violations. In the post MI LV-dysfunction series, we included 50 rats. The flow chart is shown in supplementary figure S1b. In the mitochondrial respiratory capacity and intermediary metabolism series, we included 50 rats. Supplementary Figure S1c depicts the flow chart and specifies reasons for exclusion of 21 rats.
EMPA treatment for 7 days prior to MI significantly reduced myocardial in vivo IS by 20% points compared to placebo (65 ± 7% vs. 46 ± 8%p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a). Administration of EMPA 1.5 h before MI yielded no IS reduction in vivo (p > 0.99) (Fig. 1a). AAR did not differ between groups (Fig. 1b). EMPA did not reduce IS ex vivo (63 ± 16% and 53 ± 13%, p = 0.14) or affect hemodynamic performance (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Accordingly, the RCR increased (4.0 ± 0.99 and 3.6 ± 0.97 vs. 2.2 ± 0.34, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3b).

Stimulation of complex I + II yielded an enhanced response in both EMPA-Chronic and EMPA-Acute compared to placebo (231.7 ± 59.04 and 238.1 ± 65.77 vs. 156.6 ± 40.25 mol\(\rho\) O2 s-1 mg-1, p < 0.05). State 4o respiration (non-phosphorylating respiration) and residual oxygen consumption (ROX) were similar between all groups.
Respiration with fatty acid substrates 30 min after MI was similar between all groups in complex I (non-ADP stimulated) linked respiration (Fig. 3a). In contrast, EMPA-Chronic increased complex I + II (ADP stimulated) respiration compared to placebo (99.2 ± 47.3 vs 40.8 ± 40.3 mol\(\rho\) O2 s−1 mg−1, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3a). This was reflected in an increased RCR by EMPA-Chronic (2.7 ± 0.6 vs. 1.7 ± 0.7, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3c).
At 28 days after MI EMPA-Chronic increased ADP stimulated complex I + II respiration with glucose linked substrates, but the increment was not statistically significantly different from placebo (296.3 ± 128.9 vs. 183.9 ± 81.\(\rho\) mol O2 s−1 mg−1, p = 0.17), (Fig. 4a).

Respiration with fatty acid linked substrates demonstrated an increase of complex I respiration (non-ADP stimulated) by EMPA-Chronic and EMPA-Post compared to placebo (46.6 ± 5.4 and 44.5 ± 8.3 vs. 33.2 ± 8.2 mol\(\rho\) O2 s−1 mg−1, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4a).
SHAM animals were evaluated after 28 days of exposure to either EMPA or vehicle.

Enzymatic activities of CS did not differ between either of the experimental series (Figs. 3d, 4c).
At the beginning of stabilization, the myocardial interstitial concentration of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates citrate, succinate and malate were similar in all groups (Fig. 5), but the concentration of glutamate was significantly higher in EMPA-Chronic compared to placebo and remained so during stabilization. EMPA-Acute increased the myocardial citrate level and EMPA-Chronic increased the succinate level before the induction of ischemia compared to EMPA-Chronic and placebo respectively. During ischemia, the interstitial citrate concentration was significantly higher in the EMPA-Acute group compared to EMPA-Chronic and remained continuously increased during reperfusion. The interstitial concentrations of succinate, malate and glutamate were significantly increased by EMPA-Chronic compared to placebo during ischemia and also in early reperfusion.

Data are mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is shown as * p < 0.05 EMPA-Acute vs. EMPA-Chronic, † p < 0.05 EMPA-Chronic vs. PLACEBO-Chronic.
At the end of stabilization, the interstitial concentrations of purine metabolites were similar in all study groups. Concentrations of adenosine and inosine were significantly elevated in early ischemia compared with EMPA-Acute. During early reperfusion, the interstitial concentrations of adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine were significantly increased in the EMPA-Chronic group compared to EMPA-Acute.
The interstitial concentration of lactate was significantly elevated during ischemia in EMPA-Chronic compared to EMPA-Acute but not compared to placebo.
EMPA increased circulating β-OHB acid levels after 1.5 h of its administration. After 7 days of its administration, the level of β-OHB acid was normalized (Fig. 6).

The present study demonstrates that continuous treatment with EMPA for 7 days prior to MI reduces IS in an in vivo rat heart model, while a single administration 1.5 h before MI does not. IS reduction is associated with a subsequent improvement of LV function at 28 days post MI. The most notable finding is that administration of EMPA in a post MI period of 28 days improves LV function regardless of time of therapy initiation and hence independently of IS reduction in the in vivo rat heart. The hemodynamic effect of SGLT2 inhibition was associated with an improvement in mitochondrial respiration that was documented in healthy, sham-operated rats. The cardioprotective effect and the effect on mitochondrial respiration seem to be independent of circulating β-OHB levels. Our results confirm that EMPA yields no cardioprotection in the isolated heart. EMPA did not affect mortality rate (Fig. S1).
The mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of treatment with EMPA is of importance in the light of the recent demonstration of a beneficial cardiovascular effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. Notably, the beneficial effects were obtained not only by patients with8,22 but also in patients without diabetes8,9.
In accordance with previous studies, we found that EMPA administered for one week prior to MI reduced IS in non-diabetic rat hearts23,24,25. Administration of EMPA as a single dose shortly before MI did not offer the same effect23. Even though acute intravenous administration of dapagliflozin and canagliflozin is protective26,27, this observation may indicate that the main mechanism of EMPA does not work by a primary and direct modulation of the myocardium. This assumption is supported by the fact that administration of SGLT2 inhibitors directly into the perfusate in an ex vivo, Langendorff setting leaves cardioprotection unobtainable10,12. We confirmed these findings in a Langendorff setting that eliminated any effect of circulating substances (e.g. metabolic substrates such as β-OHB), since the initial washout with high coronary flow rates rapidly dilutes substances, which are carried over from the body. Hence, the mediating cardioprotective signal appears to be dependent on a whole-body system.
EMPA improves contractility in hypoxic cardiomyocytes25. We extended these findings by demonstrating that EMPA enhanced EF irrespective of the time of treatment onset in rats with post infarction compromised LV function. Our findings demonstrated that IS reduction alone is not responsible for the effect. EMPA improved end systolic volume, while end diastolic volume remained unchanged, reflecting increased contractility. In accordance with our findings, canagliflozin increased stroke volume and myocardial efficiency without altering myocardial substrate utilization, i.e. uptake of glucose, fatty acids or ketones, in otherwise healthy swine subjected to IR injury28 and alleviated post-ischemic systolic and diastolic function in non-diabetic male rats27. Together, these findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have an inherent beneficial modulating class effect that reduces the cardiac derangements following MI.
Expectedly, the mitochondrial complex I and complex I + II linked oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity was impaired by IR injury during early reperfusion after MI. EMPA-Chronic significantly improved mitochondrial function. EMPA-Chronic also improved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The main electron entry sites in the ETS after β-oxidization of fatty acids are complexes I and II via NADH and electron transfer flavoprotein via FADH229. Hence, the increased respiration by EMPA might reflect an overall improvement in the electron flow through complex I and II, as reflected in the respiratory coupling efficiency (RCR) and driven by an increase in state 3 respiration. Reduction of the oxidative capacity of fatty acids plays an important role in the development of HF after IR injury30,31. This reduction provides an early indication of deranged cardiac mitochondrial performance in HF30. EMPA-Chronic improved both complex I and fatty acid respiration.
Because we measured mitochondrial respiration under unloaded resting conditions in the absence of EMPA or its potential mediator, the preserved mitochondrial function may favour a mechanism underlying the improved cardiac function rather than a consequence and that the modulation has already happened at the organ level in the intact body. Supporting this, we observed a significantly improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity in sham animals treated with EMPA compared with sham animals treated with placebo. Thus, our findings seem to represent a specific effect of EMPA on mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We have previously demonstrated a similar effect in an in vitro model12.
ATP degradation end products (i.e. adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine) were elevated during ischemia19. In accordance with an increased ATP-turnover from the elevated respiratory capacity, in particular during reperfusion when the respiratory chain is recovering32, we found an amplified increase in the ATP degradation products in the EMPA-Chronic group. The myocardial interstitial concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates succinate, malate and glutamate were significantly elevated in the EMPA-Chronic compared to placebo during ischemia.
In our experimental rat model, we found that levels of β-OHB increased only transiently after administration of EMPA. Conversely, in the EMPA-Chronic group, circulating β-OHB levels were normalized at the time of exposure to IR with no apparent association with the observed IS reduction. Since we were unable to associate elevated β-OHB levels in plasma with IS reduction and increased mitochondrial respiration, it seems unlikely that the cardioprotective effect should be coupled to increased β-OHB metabolism.
Some limitation must be acknowledged. We used healthy young male animals without comorbidities and without previous exposure to pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, we used a supra-therapeutic dose of EMPA to investigate the cardioprotective properties and mitochondrial modulatory effects on MI and post-MI HF. During several of the study procedures, the animals underwent anesthesia with volatile anaesthetics, which has been shown to be cardioprotective33. However, we found no differences in length of anesthesia or doses of sevoflurane between our study groups.
We found no differences in the number of mitochondria, measured by citrate synthase activity. A biomarker such as citrate synthase may not be an optimal marker for mitochondrial content across varying pathological conditions such as IR34. However, the same constraint relates to all markers that seem to have similar validity as citrate synthase35. To circumvent the limitation, we calculated the respiratory control ratio, as a reliable measure of respiratory coupling efficiency, independently from the number of mitochondria. Mitochondrial respiration was measured 30 min after reperfusion, whereas infarct size was evaluated after 2 h. The damaging process of reperfusion may extend beyond 30 min and thus mitochondrial respiration may still be significant as part of the cardioprotective mechanism, as shown in the chronic experimental series. However, the time discrepancy may explain that we found no IS reduction in EMPA-Acute animals, while mitochondrial respiratory capacity was similar to that observed in the EMPA-Chronic group. Similarly, it might explain that concentrations in intermediary metabolites were different in EMPA-Acute and EMPA-Chronic, while we found no difference in mitochondrial respiration.
The microdialysis samples were collected in 10-min spans to ensure sufficient material for analysis. This may limit the interpretation as a result of low temporal resolution compared to the rapid changes that occur during early reperfusion. Catheter implantation and surgical procedures may per se affect levels of myocardial interstitial metabolites36 and may challenge the interpretation of the physiology in our specific experimental setup. The influence was observed initially and was similar in all study groups, whereas no increase was observed in the sham group during ischemia. Hence, we considered the differences between the study groups during ischemia and reperfusion valid. Furthermore, microdialysis is not the most accurate method to estimate exact concentrations in tissues, but we chose the continuous measurement approach from the same animal to assess dynamic changes.
We did not investigate causes of mortality during the experiments, specifically we did not monitor arrhythmicity, which might have provided information about differences in causes of mortality between groups.
