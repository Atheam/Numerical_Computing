Semi-Counterfactual Quantum Bit Commitment Protocol
A semi-counterfactual quantum bit commitment (SCQBC) protocol is presented here for the first time, which makes use of counterfactual property. Similar to a counterfactual quantum key distribution scheme, half-photons are not transmitted through the quantum channel in our proposed protocol. In the SCQBC protocol, Bob, the verification party of the quantum bit commitment (QBC), sends the states while Alice, the commitment party, receives. Since Alice cannot receive all the states and entangle the commit bits with the verifier’s registers, it is not subject to Mayers’ and Lo-Chau’s no-go theorem. In addition, a general bit commitment framework can be extracted from the SCQBC scheme, which opens up a new class of cryptographic protocols in counterfactual cryptography.
The bit commitment (BC) scheme is a basic primitive of modern cryptography. The BC concept was first proposed by Blum1, and it plays a crucial role in constructions of multi-party secure computation, such as zero-knowledge proof schemes and verified secret shared schemes.
The BC scheme includes two phases, namely, the commit phase and unveil phase. In the commit phase, the commitment party Alice chooses a commit bit x and provides a piece of evidence to the verifier Bob. In the unveil phase, Alice unveils the value of x and Bob checks it. A BC scheme has the following properties. (i) Correctness. If Alice and Bob execute the scheme honestly, Bob obtains the correct commit bit x in the unveil phase. (ii) Concealing. Bob cannot know the commit bit x before the unveil phase. (iii) Binding. Alice cannot change the commit bit after the commit phase. A BC scheme is unconditionally secure if there is no computational assumption on the attacker’s ability and it satisfies both properties of concealing and binding.
There is at present no classical BC protocol that achieves unconditional security in both concealing and binding. With the development of quantum cryptography, many researchers attempted to construct unconditionally secure QBC. The first QBC scheme was proposed in2 but the binding security of the scheme can be attacked by sending entangled states. In 1993, a BCJL scheme was presented3 and it was believed provably secure over a period of time until a cheating strategy was put forward by Mayers4. Later, Mayers, Lo, and Chau separately presented the no-go theorem and proved that the unconditional secure QBC protocol is impossible5,6,7. Subsequently, a series of studies on extending the framework of the no-go theorem and further proof of the impossibility of QBC has been presented8,9,10,11,12,13. Since no-go theorem was presented, most of QBC protocols cannot realize the unconditional security anymore, especially the binding security.
The later researches focus on exploring QBC with practical security and constructing the QBC protocols evading the no-go theorem type attack. In no-go theorem, Alice prepares a series of entangled states, sends half to Bob and keeps the other half not measured in the commitment phase. In the unveil phase, Alice can apply a local unitary transformation on the remaining half qubits to rotate her commitment. It can be seen that the requirement of the no-go theorem type attack is hardly realized in practice. There are several QBC protocols proposed under the physical hypothesis, such as the bounded-quantum-storage model14,15, noisy-storage model16,17,18, technological limitations on non-demolition measurements19 and relativistic QBC protocols20,21,22. In addition, since the algorithm needs at least O(22n) size of memory space to store the matrix of the unitary transformation23, where n is the security parameter of the QBC, Song and Yang24 constructed a practical QBC protocol with physical security. On the other hand, although the correctness of the no-go theorem is not doubted, the framework of the theorem may not cover all the types of QBC protocols25. People try to construct QBC protocols to resist the attack presented by the no-go theorem26,27,28,29,30.
We are inspired by counterfactual quantum cryptography31 and try to construct a QBC protocol immune to no-go theorem type attack based on the counterfactual property. The counterfactual quantum key distribution protocol (N09) was presented by Tae-Gon Noh, in which the particle carrying secret information is not in fact transmitted through the quantum channel. The counterfactual property makes that the receiver has no idea about the information carried by the sender’s local particle as long as the responses of the detectors are not disclosed. Let the verifier Bob to be the sender of the counterfactual system and the commitment party Alice to be the receiver. It seems that there is some information gap caused by Bob’s local particles, which leads that Alice cannot dishonestly change the commitment without detection. In this paper, we show that it is possible to build a QBC protocol based on the counterfactual property, called semi-counterfactual quantum bit commitment (SCQBC), which can resist the existing no-go theorem type attack. Then we analyze the general cheating strategies, such as intercept attack and intercept/resend attack, and find there is no effective attack to break the concealing and binding security. Quite interestingly, a general BC model is extracted from SCQBC, which may provide a new idea to achieve unconditionally secure BC protocols.
Figure 1 illustrates the diagram of the experimental implementation of N0931. The aim of QKD protocols is to share the secret keys between the two parties Alice and Bob, which prevent giving out information from the eavesdroppers. Then, the positions and functions of Alice and Bob are equivalent, swapping of the positions is allowed. No matter who is the sender or the receiver, N09 protocol can be executed correctly. In QBC protocols, Alice is the commitment party while Bob is the verification party. To satisfy both binding (i.e. Alice cannot change the commitment bit x after the commit phase) and concealing (i.e. Bob cannot know x before the unveil phase), Bob is designed as the sender and Alice as the receiver. The experimental implementation of SCQBC is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.
Architecture of N09 and SCQBC protocols. The setup is a modification based on a Michelson-type interferometer. The single-photon source S emits an optical pulse containing only one photon. The pulse is then transmitted through the optical circulator C and split into two pulses by the beam splitter BS. The two light paths a and b are the arms of the Michelson-type interferometer, and the length of the path a is adjusted by an optical delay OD. The pulse transmitted through path a is reflected by the Faraday mirror FM0 and back to the BS. The pulse transmitted through path b travels to Bob’s site. If the pulse is horizontally polarized, it passes through the polarizing beam splitter PBS, or it is reflected by PBS and passes through the optical loop OL. The arrival time to the optical switch SW of the different polarized pulses is different. Only when the SW is controlled in the correct time will the pulse reach the detector D2. Otherwise, the pulse will be reflected by FM1 and return to Alice’s site. The back-pulse from path b and the pulse from path a are combined at the BS and interfered to lead the detector D0 to click.
The single-photon source S emits an optical pulse containing only one photon. The polarization of the single-photon state is chosen by Bob, the horizontal polarization |H〉 representing the bit value “0” while vertical polarization |V〉 representing the bit value “1”. The pulse then is transmitted through the optical circulator C. The circulator C is in clockwise direction, through which the left light transmits to the right optical path and the right light goes to the detector D0 in the below optical path. When Bob sends a horizontal polarized state, it split into the horizontal polarization in mode a and mode b by the beam splitter BS, denoted as |H〉a and |H〉b, respectively. |H〉a passes through the optical path only in Bob’s local site. Then it is rotated by the Faraday mirror FM0 to |V〉a and reflected back. For the other part |H〉b, it passes through the PBS and goes directly to SW. If Alice does nothing with SW, |H〉b goes to the Faraday mirror FM1, then it is rotated to |V〉b and reflected back to SW. |V〉b then is reflected by PBS, passes through the optical loop OL and goes through the quantum channel. Removing the detector D2 and optical switch SW, the remaining devices construct a conventional structure of Michelson interferometer. Through adjusting the two arms accurately, |V〉a and |V〉b arrive at BS simultaneously and the interference is detected by D0. When Bob sends a vertical polarized state |V〉, the difference with |H〉 is that |V〉b is reflected by PBS, goes through the optical loop OL. The different polarizations arrive at the switch SW in different time. Actually, Alice also chooses one of the two polarizations and blocks some of the pulses using the setup according to her bits. If Alice chooses bit “0”, corresponding to polarization |H〉, she will block the horizontal polarization in the optical path b. If Alice chooses bit “1”, she will block the vertical polarization in the optical path b. She can effectively switch the polarization state to the detector D2 by accurately controlling the switch time. When Alice’s bit is different with Bob’s, she controls the SW at the incorrect time, which is equivalent to that she does nothing, to lead the setup to form a Michelson interferometer and the detector D0 clicks. When Alice’s bit is the same as Bob’s, she controls the SW at the suitable time. In this case, the interference is destroyed and there are three occasions for the single photon. (i) Detector D0 clicks. The photon travels via path a and then is reflected by the BS to the detector D0. (ii) Detector D1 clicks. The photon travels via path a and then passes through the BS to the detector D1. (iii) Detector D2 clicks. The photon travels via path b and is controlled by the SW to the detector D2.
In N09 protocol, when the detector D0 or D2 clicks, Alice and Bob announce the detected and initial polarization states. When the detector D1 clicks, Alice compares the detected polarization with the initial polarization: if they are inconsistent, she announces the detection; otherwise, she keeps secret. Only the clicks of D1 are the generation of the secret keys, in which situation the information carriers are only transmitted in Bob’s site rather than the quantum channel. We find that if Alice and Bob keep their measurement results secret, the information obtained by them is not asymmetric. Inspired by the counterfactual property, we proposed a SCQBC protocol. Then tease out the relationship between the two parties’ bits and the response of the detectors: (i) D0 clicks. Whether the bits chosen by Alice and Bob are consistent or not, the event that the detector D0 clicks can happen. Although Bob knows the detection, he never knows Alice’s bit. (ii) D1 clicks. Only when the chosen bits are inconsistent, it is possible that D1 clicks. In this case, Bob knows Alice’s bit but the information carrier is never transmitted through the quantum channel, which is counterfactual. (iii) D2 clicks. Only when the chosen bits are inconsistent, it is possible that D2 clicks. Ideally, S is a single-photon source and there is only one photon in the system. If Bob’s detectors do not click, he knows D2 clicks and what Alice’s bit is. In addition, Alice also knows Bob’s bit. A secure QBC protocol needs to be both concealing and binding. The events that D0 clicks can guarantee the concealing, in which Bob cannot know Alice’s bits. The events that D1 or D2 clicks can be the evidence of the commitment and guarantee the binding, in which Bob knows Alice’s bit exactly and Alice’s change of these bits can be easily detected.
Before the SCQBC protocol, there are three time parameters to be determined, as follows: Δt0, the time that a photon spends from the source S through the polarizing beam splitter PBS to the optical switch SW, where the optical path of the photon is S → C → BS → PBS → SW → D2; Δt1: the time that a photon spends from the source S through the optical loop OL to the optical switch SW, where the optical path is S → C → BS → OL → SW → D2; Δt2, the time that a photon spends from the source S, reflected by FM1 to Bob’s site again, where the optical path is S → C → BS → PBS(OL) → FM1 → OL(PBS) → BS → D1(D0). Note that Δt2 is also the time that a photon spends from the source S, reflected by FM0 to Bob’s detectors, where the optical path is S → C → BS → FM0 → BS → D1(D0). Alice and Bob perform tests to measure the time parameters by sending and detecting some quantum states. To be specific, Bob sends a series of states |H〉 or |V〉 to Alice and tells her what the states are before sending. Then, Alice tries to control the optical switch SW in proper time to make detector D0, D1, D2 click, respectively. Through this test, three time parameters can be measured.
Alice and Bob set up devices according to Fig. 1, where the beam splitter BS is a standard half-transparent and half-reflecting mirror. They share four security parameters m, n, k and N.
Alice generates m bit strings randomly and uniformly with the length of N. Each sequence is represented as \({a}^{(i)}\equiv ({a}_{1}^{(i)}{a}_{2}^{(i)}\ldots {a}_{N}^{(i)})\in {\{0,1\}}^{N}\), \(i\mathrm{=1,}\,\mathrm{2,}\ldots ,m\).
Bob generates m bit strings randomly and uniformly with the length of N. Each sequence is represented as \({b}^{(i)}\equiv ({b}_{1}^{(i)}{b}_{2}^{(i)}\ldots {b}_{N}^{(i)})\in {\{0,1\}}^{N}\).
Alice and Bob decide on a series of time instants \({t}_{1}^{(i)},{t}_{2}^{(i)},\ldots ,{t}_{N}^{(i)}\). Bob sends \(|{\Psi }_{{b}_{j}^{(i)}}\rangle \) at the time \({t}_{j}^{(i)}\), while Alice controls the switch with bit \({a}_{j}^{(i)}\). When \({a}_{j}^{(i)}\mathrm{=0}\), she controls SW at the time \({t}_{j}^{(i)}+\Delta {t}_{0}\); when \({a}_{j}^{(i)}=1\), she controls SW at the time \({t}_{j}^{(i)}+\Delta {t}_{1}\). \(|{\Psi }_{0}\rangle =|H\rangle \) and \(|{\Psi }_{1}\rangle =|V\rangle \) represent the horizontally polarized state and vertically polarized state, respectively.
Alice and Bob record the response of the detector D2, D0, and D1 as α ∈ {0, 1}, β0 ∈ {0, 1}, and β1 ∈ {0, 1}, respectively. α, β0, and β1 = 0 denote that there is no click in the related detector. α, β0, and β1 = 1 denote the related detector clicks. Note that as long as the detectors do not click in the correct time they record the result “0.” For example, if Bob’s detectors D0 and D1 have not clicked until \({t}_{j}^{(i)}+\Delta {t}_{2}\), he records β0 = β1 = 0.
For each sequence of states, Alice verifies whether the detection of D2 is approximately N/4. If the proportion is incongruent, she believes that Bob cheated and she aborts. For each sequence of states, Bob selects k bits to be verified, then asks Alice to publish the corresponding values of \({a}_{j}^{(i)}\) and the response of the detector D2.
Alice chooses a random bit x ∈ {0, 1} as her committed bit. Then she selects n bits from the N − k bits except the verified bits, which satisfies \({a}_{1}^{(i)}\oplus {a}_{2}^{(i)}\oplus \ldots \oplus {a}_{n}^{(i)}=x\).
Alice reveals the value of x, m sequences of \(({a}_{1}^{(i)}{a}_{2}^{(i)}\ldots {a}_{N}^{(i)})\), \(i=\mathrm{1,}\,\mathrm{2,}\ldots ,m\), the response of the detector D2 and the index of n bits of each sequence to Bob.
Bob verifies whether \({a}_{1}^{(i)}\oplus {a}_{2}^{(i)}\oplus \ldots \oplus {a}_{n}^{(i)}=x\), and the response of all the detectors agree with the state \(|{\Psi }_{{b}_{j}^{(i)}}\rangle \). If the consistency of all of the data holds, he admits Alice’s commitment value as x; otherwise, if any of the data are inconsistent, he concludes that Alice cheated.
The commit bit \(x={a}_{1}^{(i)}\oplus {a}_{2}^{(i)}\oplus \ldots \oplus {a}_{n}^{(i)}\). It is oblivious that when both two parities execute the SCQBC honestly, all of the devices used are ideal and perfect, Bob can obtain the correct commit bit.
In a secure BC protocol, Alice chooses a commit bit x and gives a piece of evidence to Bob. The key point is that Bob cannot recover the commit bit by the evidence and Alice cannot change the commit bit without detection due to the limitation of the evidence. For SCQBC protocol, the evidence is the data detected by D1 and D2, in which situation that Bob knows exactly that \({a}_{j}^{(i)}={b}_{j}^{(i)}\). When the detector D1 clicks, the particle generated by Bob is not transmitted through the quantum channel but carries the information of \({a}_{j}^{(i)}={b}_{j}^{(i)}\), which satisfies the counterfactual property. When the detector D2 clicks, the particle generated by Bob is transmitted through the quantum channel to Alice’s side with the information of \({a}_{j}^{(i)}={b}_{j}^{(i)}\), which is a factual phenomenon. Above all, some particles carrying evidence information are transmitted in the channel while others are not. It is the reason why Protocol 1 is defined as the semi-counterfactual quantum bit commitment rather than counterfactual protocol.
There is a general framework of bit commitment protocol extracted from the SCQBC protocol, which is described as follows.
Alice and Bob agree on two security parameters m and n.
Alice chooses a random bit \(x\in \mathrm{\{0,}\,\mathrm{1\}}\) as her committed bit. Then, she generates m random bit strings according to the value of x. Each sequence consists of n bits, which can be represented as \({a}^{(i)}\equiv ({a}_{1}^{(i)}{a}_{2}^{(i)}\mathrm{..}.{a}_{n}^{(i)})\in {\{0,1\}}^{n}\), \(i=\mathrm{1,}\,\mathrm{2,}\,\mathrm{...,}\,m\). Each sequence satisfies \({a}_{1}^{(i)}\oplus {a}_{2}^{(i)}\oplus \mathrm{.}..\oplus {a}_{n}^{(i)}=x\).
Bob generates m bit strings randomly and uniformly with the length of n. Each sequence is represented as \({b}^{(i)}\equiv ({b}_{1}^{(i)}{b}_{2}^{(i)}\mathrm{..}.{b}_{n}^{(i)})\in {\{0,1\}}^{n}\).
Alice and Bob invoke another particular bit-comparison function module as a black box to give some evidence of commitment to Bob. In this step, Bob compares \({b}_{j}^{(i)}\) with \({a}_{j}^{(i)}\) bit-by-bit and knows \({b}_{j}^{(i)}={a}_{j}^{(i)}\), \({b}_{j}^{(i)}\ne {a}_{j}^{(i)}\), or nothing. For each bit-comparison, Bob can confirm the value of Alice’s bit with a probability p and Alice knows that Bob confirms her bit with a probability q, where 0 ≤ q < p < 1.
Alice reveals the value of x and m sequences \(({a}_{1}^{(i)}{a}_{2}^{(i)}\ldots {a}_{n}^{(i)})\), i = 1, 2, …, m to Bob.
From the particular bit-comparison scheme, Bob knows some of Alice’s bits. Therefore, Bob can verify whether Alice’s opening results are consistent with the bits he knows. Then, he needs to verify whether \({a}_{1}^{(i)}\oplus {a}_{2}^{(i)}\oplus \mathrm{.}..\oplus {a}_{n}^{(i)}=x\). If the consistency of all the data holds, he admits Alice’s commitment value as x; otherwise, if any of the data are inconsistent, he concludes that Alice cheated.
In Step 4, there is a bit comparison black box. In the SCQBC protocol, the black box is realized by the counterfactual setup. The complete security proof of the BC framework and other constructions of the black box are left for future study. However, the framework may open up a new idea for unconditionally secure BC protocols.
