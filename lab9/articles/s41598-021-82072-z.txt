Osteoprotegerin is a marker of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3–5
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), known to regulate bone mass by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation, might also play a role in vascular calcification. Increased circulating OPG levels in patients with CKD are associated with aortic calcification and increased mortality. We assessed the predictive role of OPG for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD stages 3–5 over a 5-year follow-up period. We evaluated the relationship between OPG and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 145 CKD patients (stages 3–5) in a prospective observational follow-up study. Inflammation markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, standard echocardiography, and estimation of intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery, were assessed at baseline, and correlations with OPG levels were determined. The cutoff values for OPG were defined using ROC curves for cardiovascular mortality. Survival was assessed during follow up lasting for up to 5.5 years using Fine and Gray model. A total of 145 (89 men; age 58.9 ± 15.0 years) were followed up. The cutoff value for OPG determined using ROC was 10 pmol/L for general causes mortality and 10.08 pmol/L for CV causes mortality. Patients with higher serum OPG levels presented with higher mortality rates compared to patients with lower levels. Aalen–Johansen cumulative incidence curve analysis demonstrated significantly worse survival rates in individuals with higher baseline OPG levels for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, OPG was a marker of general and cardiovascular mortality independent of sex, age, CVD, diabetes, and CRP levels. When CKD stages were included in the multivariate analysis, OPG was an independent marker of all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality. Elevated serum OPG levels were associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of age, CVD, diabetes, and inflammatory markers, in patients with CKD.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for about 30% of deaths worldwide1 and is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)2. However, the high prevalence of traditional risk factors cannot fully explain the high incidence of fatal events in this population3, 4. Therefore, in the last decade, other risk factors, such as markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular calcification, have been studied5,6,7. In this context, osteoprotegerin (OPG) has become the subject of increased interest because of its role as a cardiovascular risk factor in both the general population as well as in CKD patients8.
OPG is a soluble receptor of the osteoclast activator, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and has been studied as an important marker of CVD in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis9, 10. Elevated serum OPG levels seem to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between circulating OPG levels and mortality in the general population11.
OPG has also been associated with higher mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis12. In a preliminary observational study, our research group found a significant association between elevated OPG levels and the presence of increased all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3–5 over a 3-year follow-up period13. To date, our research group has not studied the association between elevated serum OPG levels and cardiovascular mortality or its interaction with other myocardial injury markers.
We hypothesized a possible correlation between elevated serum OPG levels in patients with CKD stages 3–5 and markers of presence and severity of CVD, and investigated whether OPG is a possible independent marker of cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD over a 5-year follow-up period.
Altogether, 145 (89 males) patients, including 54 non-dialysis patients with CKD stages 3–5, 36 hemodialysis (HD) patients, and 55 peritoneal dialysis patients, fulfilled the study eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in the study. All dialysis patients did not present residual diuresis. Of the patients under conservative treatment, 9 started dialysis therapy during the period observed. The median follow-up was 36, 5 months, the minimum 0, 4 month and the maximum 66 months.
The OPG cutoff value determined using the ROC curve for all causes mortality was 10 pmol/L (area under de curve [AUC] 0.81; CI 95%: 0.73–0.88; p < 0.001) and 10.08 pmol/L for CV mortality (AUC 0.75; CI 95%: 0.65–0.85, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1).

Clinical and biochemical characteristics of the 145 patients included in the study are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The levels of OPG for the whole cohort had a median value of 8.91 (25–75th percentiles 6.51–12.43) pmol/L.
Univariate correlations, assessed using Spearman’s rank, demonstrated that OPG levels were significantly associated with age (r = 0.37, p < 0.01), left ventricle mass index (r = 0.23, p = 0.007), S100 calcium-binding protein A12 (S100A12) (r = 0.21, p = 0.010), receptor for advanced glycation end products soluble form (sRAGE) (r = 0.33, p < 0.001), IL-6 (r = 0.39, p < 0.001), FGF-23 (r = 0.26, p = 0.001), hsCRP (r = 0.25, p = 0.003), troponin I (r = 0.54, p < 0.001), IMT (r = 0.40, p < 0.001), and ejection fraction, EF (r = −0.22, p = 0.010). However, when a multivariate analysis was performed, only age (p < 0.001), fibroblast growth factor-23 (p = 0.005), IL-6 (p = 0.017), troponin I (p = 0.002) and sRAGE (p = 0.002) were independently correlated with OPG levels.
Univariate analysis of mortality showed that elevated OPG levels (> 10 pg/mL for general causes death and > 10.08 pg/mL for CV death) were related to higher mortality for both general and cardiovascular causes (SHR 6.81; CI 95%: 3.69–12.6, p < 0.001 and SHR 5.47; CI 95%: 2.24–13.4, p < 0.001, respectively), together with levels of serum troponin (SHR = 7.73, CI 95%: 3.17–18.8, p < 0.001 and SHR 10.8, CI 95%: 4.79–22.8), p < 0.001, respectively) and log(sRAGE) levels (SHR = 1.47, CI 95%: 0.87–2.49, p = 0.150 and SHR 2.07; CI 95%: 1.07–3.95, p = 0.035, respectively), and treatment by dialysis (SHR 4.80, CI 95%: 2.17–10.6, p < 0.001 and SHR 8.73, CI 95%: 1.86–32.5, p = 0.003, respectively).
Aalen–Johansen cumulative incidence curves showed a higher mortality for general (Fig. 2) and cardiovascular (Fig. 3) causes in the group with elevated OPG (> 10 pmol/L for general causes and > 10.08 pmol/L for CV causes) early in the follow-up period, with an increase in the gap over time (during the follow-up period, 25 patients had undergone kidney transplantation and 16 were lost to follow-up, of which 9 were in the non-dialysis group). The number of deaths was 56 (cardiovascular: 25; infection: 17; malignances: 4; and other causes: 10).

In multivariate analysis, in a model including gender and age, OPG was found to be an independent marker of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. When presence of previous CVD and diabetes, and hsCRP, were added, the results were similar. However, when CKD stages were included in the analysis, OPG was an independent marker only for all-cause mortality. (Tables 3, 4).
The main cause of death in our cohort was cardiovascular diseases, accounting for 45% (25 cases) of all deaths. This result is in line with those reported in the current literature, wherein large population studies have shown a progressive increase in the incidence of cardiovascular mortality with worsening renal function17.
The main finding in the present study was that OPG was a marker of higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, regardless of gender and age and other cardiovascular risk factors such as presence of diabetes, previous history of CVD as well as inflammation. We have been previously reported that an increased OPG concentration was associated with increased all-cause 3-year mortality risk among patients with CKD stages 3–513. In the current study, the follow-up of this cohort was extended to 5, 5 years and, in addition to all-cause mortality risk, we also analyzed the association of OPG with cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, the quality of the analysis was improved as we applied a ROC derived cut-off level of OPG in the survival analyses. The present results corroborate the results of several other studies, including those by Morena et al. and Matsubara et al. who found higher mortality in dialysis patients with high OPG levels18, 19. Recently, Alderson et al. reported that OPG levels were associated with increased mortality risk in the CKD population8. Kuźniewski et al. proposed that the relationship between OPG and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) would act as a marker of increased cardiovascular mortality risk in stage 5 CKD patients, and, in their study, isolated OPG values were also able to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality20. In a recent meta-analysis Huang et al. found a relationship between OPG and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, however, cited as some limitations: most studies including only dialysis patients, lack of adjustment for potential confounders and the lack of several studies in the area21. Altogether these studies suggest that an elevated circulating concentration of OPG appears to be a marker for increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk in patients with CKD.
Although OPG is classically associated with vascular calcification, the exact mechanisms by which OPG may lead to higher mortality are still unknown. One of the current theories is that OPG is also a marker of atherosclerotic disease and myocardial ischemia22,23,24,25,26. Our results demonstrated that circulating OPG levels were directly correlated with serum troponin levels, one of the main markers of myocardial damage, corroborating these data.
Regarding cardiovascular disease, another possible question would be the relationship between OPG and ventricular function, since it is possible that OPG can also be secreted by the heart27. While previous studies were divergent regarding this relationship, Lindberg et al. found a correlation between OPG levels and a lower ejection fraction in patients after an acute ischemic event in a study including 42 patients. However, Shetelig et al. did not find this relationship in 272 patients with coronary disease28, 29. While our study found no independent correlation between OPG and ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, or increased ventricular mass, OPG was a marker of increased mortality independent of the presence of previously known heart disease in patients with CKD, when this and other well established risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, and inflammation) were included in a multivariate analysis.
Some authors propose that high OPG levels may be a direct consequence of vascular inflammation19. Other studies have demonstrated that OPG expression can be induced by the vascular musculature through inflammatory cytokines, reinforcing this idea30, 31. However, our study did not find a correlation between inflammatory markers and OPG, and when an inflammation marker (hsCRP) was included in the multivariate analysis, OPG remained as an independent marker of cardiovascular mortality. Sigrist et al. reported similar results, in that high levels of OPG were associated with higher mortality independently of hsCRP levels in patients with CKD32.
Recently, Wieczorek-Surdacka et al.33 reported that elevated levels of OPG were associated with a worse renal and cardiovascular outcome in patients with chronic renal disease and stable coronary artery disease and that there was an independent relationship between elevated levels of OPG and low homoarginine (hArg)/symmetric dimethylarginine ratio (ADMA). However, our study did not include measurements of hArg or serum ADMA.
When CKD stages were included in the multivariate analysis, OPG was an independent marker of all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality. This may to some extent reflect the link between elevated OPG levels and poor renal function34, and by the fact that cardiovascular mortality is increased in patients CKD stage 5, especially in those undergoing dialysis35.
