While the prognostic impact of QRS axis deviation has been assessed, it has never been investigated in patients without conduction block. Thus, we evaluated the prognostic impact of QRS-axis deviation in patients without conduction block. We retrospectively analyzed 3353 patients who had undergone both scheduled transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography in 2013 in a hospital-based population, after excluding patients with a QRS duration of ≥ 110 ms, pacemaker placement, and an QRS-axis − 90° to − 180° (northwest axis). The study population was categorized into three groups depending on the mean frontal plane QRS axis as follows: patients with left axis deviation (N = 171), those with right axis deviation (N = 94), and those with normal axis (N = 3088). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events. The cumulative 3-year incidence of the primary outcome measure was significantly higher in the left axis deviation group (26.4% in the left axis deviation, 22.7% in the right axis deviation, and 18.4% in the normal axis groups, log-rank P = 0.004). After adjusting for confounders, the excess risk of primary outcome measure remained significant in the left axis deviation group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.95; P = 0.02), while the excess risk of primary outcome measure was not significant in the right axis deviation group (HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.76–1.96; P = 0.41). Left axis deviation was associated with a higher risk of a composite of all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events in hospital-based patients without conduction block in Japan.
QRS axis deviation can be easily determined in electrocardiograms (ECGs). Although left axis deviation is often an age-related physiological change1,2,3, it may indicate the presence of various conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy4, left anterior fascicular block5, inferior wall myocardial infarction6, emphysema7, and mechanical shift due to elevated diaphragm because of obesity8. Right axis deviation is usually seen in children and young adults under physiological conditions3,9. However, most causes of pathological conditions in right axis deviation are right ventricular hypertrophy10, lateral myocardial infarction11, altered conduction pathways5, and changes in the position of the heart in the chest12.
While the prognostic impact of QRS axis deviation in patients including a wide QRS complex has been assessed from the 1980s in Western countries11,13,14,15, it has never been investigated in patients without conduction block in Asian population. Thus, the present study investigated the prognostic impact of QRS axis deviation with QRS duration less than 110 ms and performed multivariable adjustment to assess the adjusted risk of QRS axis deviation.
This study included 171 patients (5.1%) with left axis deviation, 94 patients (2.8%) with right axis deviation, and 3088 patients (92.1%) with normal axis (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. The patients with left axis deviation were older, were more often men, and were more likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, and a high LV mass index than those with normal axis (Table 1). The patients with right axis deviation were younger and more likely to have atrial fibrillation. The baseline characteristics using QRS ≥ 100 ms as exclusion criteria are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
The median follow-up duration was 1273 (IQR 426–1467) days, with a 80.4% follow-up rate at 1 year. The cumulative 3-year incidence of the primary outcome measure was significantly higher in the left axis deviation group (left axis deviation: 26.4%, right axis deviation: 22.7%, and normal axis: 18.4%: log-rank P = 0.004) (Fig. 2A). After adjusting for confounders, the excess risk of primary outcome measure remained significant in the left axis deviation group (HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.07–1.95; P = 0.02), while the excess risk of primary outcome measure was not significant in the right axis deviation group (Table 2). The cumulative 3-year incidences of secondary outcome measures did not differ significantly among the three groups (Fig. 2B,C). After adjusting for confounders, the excess risks of the secondary outcome measures, all-cause death and MACE, respectively, were not significant in the left axis deviation group (Table 2). The excess risks of the secondary outcome measures were not significant in the right axis deviation group (Table 2).

When we used the Japanese criteria which define wide QRS complex as a QRS duration of ≥ 100 ms, the results were fully consistent with the main analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2).
We retrospectively analyzed 4444 patients who had undergone simultaneous scheduled transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography at outpatient visits or stable in-hospital conditions at Kitano Hospital in 2013, which were ordered at the physician’s discretion. A flowchart of the study population is shown in Fig. 1. We excluded 1091 patients who did not meet the criteria for follow-up, QRS duration ≥ 110 ms (N = 893), pacemaker placement (N = 173), and QRS-axis range of − 90° to − 180° (northwest axis) (N = 25). The study population comprised 3353 patients, who were categorized into three groups depending on the mean frontal plane QRS-axis as follows: left axis deviation (− 30° to − 90°), right axis deviation (90° to 180°), and normal axis (− 30° to + 90°). We used the AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendation of ≥ 110 ms QRS duration as a wide QRS complex definition16.

As a supplementary analysis, we also adopted Japanese recommendation of ≥ 100 ms QRS duration as a wide QRS complex definition17. A flowchart of the study population using QRS ≥ 100 ms as exclusion criteria is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kitano Hospital (approval no. P16-02-005)18,19. The requirement of informed consent was waived because of the retrospective study design. We disclosed the details of the present study to the public as an opt-out method and the notice clearly informed patients of their right to refuse enrollment. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as reflected in a priori approval by the institution’s Human Research Committee. Patient records and information were anonymized and deidentified before analysis.
Using the ECG database, we extracted data regarding QRS duration and the mean frontal plane QRS axis18. Using the transthoracic echocardiography database, we extracted data regarding wall thickness, left ventricular (LV) diastolic dimensions, LV systolic dimensions, left atrial dimension, left atrial volume index, LV ejection fraction, transmitral flow, tissue Doppler imaging, and body mass index (BMI)19,20,21,22,23,24. Based on the transthoracic echocardiography data along with the catheter suite database, we identified patients with previous myocardial infarction or structural heart disease. LV mass index and relative wall thickness were calculated using the formula recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography25. A high LV mass index was defined as LV mass index > 115 g/m2 for men and > 95 g/m2 for women. The LV ejection fraction was measured using the Teichholz or modified Simpson’s rule methods. All transthoracic echocardiography measurements were performed using the average of at least three cardiac cycles. We also extracted patient information from their electronic medical records at our institution, including age, sex, and type of disease (i.e., ischemic heart disease, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes I20, I21, I22, I23, I24, and I25; hypertension, ICD-10 codes I10, I11, I12, I13, I14, and I15; dyslipidemia, ICD-10 code E78; diabetes mellitus, ICD-10 codes E10, E11, E12, E13, and E14; and chronic kidney disease, ICD-10 code N18)18,19. Follow-up data from serial clinic visits until June 2017 were also collected retrospectively from electronic medical records.
The primary outcome measure was a composite of all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, and emerging aorta and peripheral vascular disease, including treatment for aortic aneurysm, all of which required unplanned hospitalization. The secondary outcome measures were all-cause death and MACE, separately.
Categorical variables are presented as numbers with percentages and were compared using the chi square test or Fisher’s exact tests. Continuous variables are expressed as means with standard deviations and were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. We compared the patient characteristics and 3-year clinical outcomes among the three groups with (1) left axis deviation, (2) right axis deviation, and (3) normal axis. The cumulative incidences of clinical events were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, and intergroup differences were assessed using the log-rank tests. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of primary and secondary outcomes associated with the three groups. The model also included the following nine clinically relevant covariates: age > 70 years, BMI > 25 kg/m2, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, LV ejection fraction < 50%, and high LV mass index. In a supplementary analysis, we used the Japanese criteria which define wide QRS complex as a QRS duration of ≥ 100 ms17 and excluded patients with QRS ≥ 100 ms from the analysis. The results are expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were performed by physicians (YS and TK) using JMP 15. All reported P values are two-tailed and the level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
