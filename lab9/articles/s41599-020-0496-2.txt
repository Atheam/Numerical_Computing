The Rosetta Stone and the Nemrud Nomos: the discovery of significant textual and astronomical similarities
Commagene was an independent and wealthy kingdom in the east of present Turkey from ca. 160 to 20 BCE. A text referred to as Nomos (Dörner) describes the astro-religion of Commagene (Crijns). The text on the Egyptian Rosetta Stone describes the Ptolemaic astro-religion (Rosetta Stone Online Project). It is shown here that the Rosetta text is a precursor of the Nomos, based on textual and astronomical evidence. The coronation dates as mentioned in both texts display a similar configuration in the sky as substantiated by the configuration on the Lion Horoscope at the top of Mt. Nemrud. Not only the date can be calculated, but also the precise time. The time is determined by an annual phenomenon of the marker star Sirius and Regulus, respectively. The latter has been overseen by scholars and underlines the importance of having at least a basic understanding of archaeoastronomy. These unnoticed similarities indicate that the astro-religions of the Middle East are not stand alone cults. The significant similarities point at a shared heritage i.e., a star cult dating maybe as far back as the era of the Fertile Crescent at the dawn of mankind.
The Nomos of Commagene is proclaimed by king Antiochus I (Dörner and Young, 1996; Crijns, 2014). The text is inscribed at the back of five colossal statues on top of Mt. Nemrud, the paramount sanctuary (Fig. 1).

The Rosetta text is proclaimed by the Egyptian priests, who glorify the benevolent Ptolemaic king and his divine cult. The Ptolemies issued a series of decrees to cement their rule over the course of their reign (Manning, 2012).Footnote 1 The Rosetta Stone of Ptolemy V is the most famous one, because it enabled the deciphering of hieroglyphs (Wallis Budge, 1913).Footnote 2 The decree was issued in 196 BCE on behalf of king Ptolemy V to commemorate his coronation nine years before, in 205 BCE. In that year, his father Ptolemy IV assigned his five year old son as co-ruler. The coronation of the boy was an excellent opportunity to reinforce his rule. To create more acceptance from the native Egyptians, Ptolemy IV shifted the location of the ceremony from the Macedonian capital Alexandria to Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt.
Both texts follow a similar pattern and were displayed on steles spread across the kingdom. Both kings identified themselves with a star. Both texts state the same festivals i.e., the royal birthday and the coronation day. Both were celebrated annually, as well as monthly. In both celestial configurations, the Sun is located at a cardinal point. The planets are visible, even Mercury. The time of both coronations is determined by the setting of their marker stars i.e., Sirius of Egypt and Regulus of Commagene. The decrees, as well as the celestial configurations of the coronation dates are similar. Such configurations are rare: ‘That this specific planetary configuration [read: Lion Horoscope] can be found in the era of Commagene and not in any other era over a period of 10,000 years is unique and statistically significant’ (Crijns, 2014).
An explanation of the similarities may be that the Ptolemaic Rosetta text was a blueprint for the Nomos decree of Antiochus. Another explanation may be that the texts were designed independently i.e., the Rosetta and the Nomos cult developed independently. In that case, the significant similarities point at a shared heritage i.e., a star cult dating from earlier times, maybe as far back as the era of the Fertile Crescent at the dawn of mankind.
The phenomena in the heavens are strongly anchored in the cults of all ancient civilizations.
A basic knowledge of astronomy is required to understand the mindset of the ancients. Sir Norman Lockyer wished that ‘every archaeologist would learn just a little astronomy’ (Michell, 1977).
Archaeoastronomy is a great step forward, but does not provide for a basic knowledge among the common archeologist. In depth archaeoastronomical research is required to understand the interrelated connections of the cultures in the Middle East i.e., the Fertile Crescent.
