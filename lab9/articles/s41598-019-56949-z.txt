MIF gene rs755622 polymorphism positively associated with acute coronary syndrome in Chinese Han population: case–control study
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been recognized as a major player in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This study determined the association between polymorphisms of MIF gene and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The polymorphism of MIF gene (rs755622, rs1007888 and rs2096525) was analyzed in 1153 healthy controls and 699 ACS cases in Chinese Han population. Plasma MIF level was also measured in part of ACS patients (139/19.9%) and healthy controls (129/11.2%) randomly. Most participants including healthy controls and ACS patients carried rs755622 GG (63.1% vs. 56.7%) and CG genotypes (33.1% vs. 38.9%) and G allele of rs755622 (79.6% vs. 76.1%, respectively), while CC genotype (3.8% vs. 4.4%) and C allele (20.4% vs. 23.9%) carriers were the lowest. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that carriers with rs755622 C allele had a higher risk of ACS compared to other genotypes (AOR = 1.278, 95% CI: 1.042–1.567). In addition, CC genotype carriers had the highest plasma levels of MIF than other genotype carriers. The MIF level in ACS patients with CC genotype was significantly higher than ACS patients carrying GG genotype and healthy controls carrying 3 different genotypes of MIF gene rs755622. Our findings indicate that MIF gene rs755622 variant C allele is associated with increased risk of ACS. Identification of this MIF gene polymorphism may help for predicting the risk of ACS.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for about 30% of deaths globally in 2012 and approximately 70% of deaths in developing countries1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an urgent condition of CAD due to a rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque in coronary arteries. The complexity of CAD pathogenesis poses significant challenges to decision making for effective interventions. Use of multi-marker algorithms including biological markers and genetic markers will improve prediction of CAD risk in clinic2.
Inflammation plays critical roles in CAD and participates pivotally in almost every stage of atherosclerosis including initiation, progression and destabilization of plaque and myocardial infarction3. MIF is produced by different cell types such as immune cells (monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes) and endocrine, endothelial and epithelial cells4. It has been proved that MIF plays an essential role in a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders5,6 as well as in cancer7,8. Previous studies have also revealed a critical role of MIF in atherosclerosis9,10, therefore, MIF is very likely associated with the risk of ACS.
The human MIF gene locates at chromosome region 22q11.2 comprising approximately 800 nucleotides and containing 3 exons and 2 introns11. At least five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human MIF gene locating at -173G/C (rs755622), +254 (rs2096525), +656 (rs2070766), 3.8 kb 3′ of the translation termination codon (rs1007888) and -794 CATT5-8 microsatellite have been mainly reported. Loci rs2096525 and rs2070766 locate at introns, rs755622 and -794 CATT5-8 locate at the promoter region of MIF and rs1007888 located in the 3′ flanking region of the MIF gene. Of them, -173G/C (rs755622) and -794 CATT5-8 have been reported to be associated with CAD12,13,14.
Xinjiang, the northwest part of China, is a region with multiple ethnic populations. People living in Xinjiang have some special life styles and habits which are different from other regions of China, for example more meat, dairy products and alcohol consumption. Our previous epidemiological investigation revealed the prevalence of hypertension (33.4%15 vs. 27.9%16), dyslipidemia (53.3%17 vs. 40.4%16), type-2 diabetes (9.26%18 vs. 5.5%19) and obesity [(1082/5757, unpublished data) vs. 11.9%16] in Chinese Han population in Xinjiang were higher than other parts of China. It is expected that a higher prevalence of CAD in Xinjiang with an association of the higher prevalence of all major risk factors i.e. hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and obesity. Moreover, a significant difference in prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors and adverse risk profiles among different ethnic groups in Xinjiang has been reported20. We have previously demonstrated that there was a significant association between the polymorphism of MIF gene -173G/C (rs755622) and CAD and severity of coronary lesions in Chinese Kazakh population13. Considering potential genetic influence and MIF as a key factor in atherosclerotic plaque formation, in this study, we investigate, in Han Chinese population, whether the variants of MIF gene predispose to ACS and have function influence on circulating plasma MIF level in both healthy controls and ACS patients.
A total of 699 ACS patients (mean age 59.1 ± 10.1 years and 61.7% men) and 1153 healthy controls (mean age 58.7 ± 11.1 years and 55.1% men) were recruited in the present study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all participants are summarized in Table 1. ACS patients were older and had greater BMI and levels of glucose, LDL-C and TG and higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypercholesteremia and hyper-LDL-C but lower HDL-C level compared to healthy controls (all P < 0.05).
Three SNPs of MIF (rs755622, rs1007888, and rs2096525) were successfully genotyped in all ACS patients and healthy controls (Table 2). The MAF of rs755622, rs1007888 and rs2096525 were 0.239, 0.483 and 0.212, respectively. All the genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in distribution of genotypes or alleles rates in rs1007888 and rs2096525 between ACS and control groups (P > 0.05). However, we found significant differences of genotypic and allelic distribution in rs755622. The frequency of the CC genotype in ACS patients was higher than that in control subjects (4.4% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.024). Moreover, the frequency of the C allele was also higher in the ACS than that in control group (23.9% vs. 20.4%, P = 0.012).
Univariate regression analysis showed that the C allele in rs755622 was the risk factor for ACS (CG and CC genotype vs. GG genotype, OR = 1.306, 95% CI, 1.078–1.581, P = 0.006). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was further used to detect the association between rs755622 polymorphisms and susceptibility of ACS. After adjusting the confounding factors including age, gender, BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, TG, TC, HDL–C and LDL–C, the C allele remained the independent risk factor for ACS (CG and CC genotype vs. GG genotype, AOR = 1.278, 95% CI, 1.042–1.567, P = 0.019, Table 3). However, no difference was observed in the other two SNPs.
The relationship between plasma MIF levels and MIF gene rs755622 polymorphisms (GG, CG and CC genotypes) were further evaluated. CC genotype carriers had the highest plasma levels of MIF than CG and GG genotype carriers. The MIF level in ACS patients with CC genotype was 6.5% and 15.6% higher than that in ACS patients carrying CG and GG genotypes, respectively. MIF levels in ACS patients carrying C allele (both in CG and CC phenotypes) were also significantly higher than healthy controls carrying the same phenotypes (Fig. 1, all P < 0.05).

Many factors involve in the development and progression of the coronary artery atherosclerosis. Inflammation is one of the most important risk factors in the pathogenesis of ACS. Variations in multiple genes involved in inflammation, and previous studies showed that there were close relationships between PPARα, interleukin 18 (IL-18), IL-1β, SIRT2, and CD14 receptor and incidence of acute myocardial infarction24,25,26,27. In the present study, we found the polymorphism (rs755622) of MIF gene was significantly associated with the risk of ACS in Chinese Han population.
MIF was initially identified more than 6 decades ago as T-cell–derived cytokine with a function to inhibit random migration of macrophages in vitro28. Over the years, MIF has been generally believed to be a multifaceted cytokine and a critical mediator of the host immune response and inflammation. Previous studies show that MIF is a key modulator which promotes and modulates the magnitude of the acute inflammatory response, such as acute lung injury29, acute kidney injury30, acute adipose tissue inflammation31 and acute rheumatic fever32. MIF has been also proved to be associated with vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaque9,33. Several studies have documented that MIF regulates inflammatory cell recruitment to lesion areas through interaction with the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR434. MIF is highly expressed in vulnerable plaques and it can enhance expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby contributing to destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque34,35.
In this case–control study, we evaluated the associations between the MIF genetic variants (rs755622, rs1007888, and rs2096525) and ACS in Chinese Han population living in Xinjiang. We found that participants with rs755622 GC and CC genotypes were more susceptible to ACS than those with GG genotype allele after adjustments for potential confounding factors. A similar finding was also reported in a small case-control study conducted in other Chinese population36. Our previous study reported that Chinese Kazakh carrying MIF rs755622 CC genotype or C allele had an increased risk of CAD13. Some studies conducted in other races also found a close association between MIF gene polymorphism and CAD. In ONICA/KORA case-cohort study, carriers of the minor alleles rs755622C and rs2070766G had a higher risk for incident CAD in southern Germany37. In a western Mexican population, association between MIF -794 (CATT)5-8 polymorphism and susceptibility of ACS was detected14. This information indicates that MIF is a promising genetic marker for predicting the risk of CAD. However, some negative findings were also reported. A study conducted in Czech and Russian population failed to detect a significant difference in the distribution of MIF -173G/C genotypes, alleles or carriage rates between patients with myocardial infarction and control groups38. The lack of association between CAD class and MIF -794 (CATT)5-8 polymorphisms with soluble MIF levels in a small number of CAD subjects (n = 70) was reported39. Although the reason for these discrepant results is not defined, it may be due to the difference in the stage of CAD and phenotypic variance, therefore a large scare of clinical study is warranted to confirm the universal implication of MIF gene polymorphism in predicting the risk of CAD.
Further, in the present study, we also measured plasma MIF levels in part of ACS patients and healthy controls. We found that CC phenotype carriers had the highest MIF levels. MIF levels in ACS patients carrying C allele (both in CG and CC phenotypes) were significantly higher than healthy controls carrying the same phenotypes and also higher than ACS patients carrying GG phenotype. Similar findings were also reported in a small case-control study with a higher plasma MIF level in MIF-173C carriers than in MIF-173G carriers36. Another study including 138 ACS and 98 stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients documented that ACS patients had significantly higher plasma MIF levels compared with SAP patients33. In both ACS and SAP patients, plasma MIF levels increased in conjunction with the extent of complex lesions33. Our previous study in Chinese Kazakh population also revealed that CAD patients with rs755622 C allele (CC and CG genotype) have higher levels of Gensini score when compared to C allele noncarriers13. These findings further demonstrate the functional link between MIF gene polymorphism, especially -173C (rs755622) carrying and associated MIF production during occurrence of ACS and CAD and the severity of coronary lesion. Indeed, our previous study showed that plasma MIF levels in ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) correlated with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived infarct size, ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, suggesting that plasma MIF levels are predictive of final infarct size and the extent of cardiac remodeling10.
Taken together, MIF gene polymorphism in general population may bear predictive value for the risk of CAD, while in ACS or CAD patients MIF gene polymorphism with CC genotype and C allele carrying in conjunction with plasma MIF levels may add values for predicting the severity of CAD and even prognosis.
There are several limitations in this study. First, we only studied the association between three SNP of MIF gene (rs755622, rs1007888 and rs2096525) and risk of ACS in Chinese Han population in Xinjiang and did not cover the other variations of the MIF gene such as -794 (CATT)5-8 MIF polymorphism. Second, the study population is relative small although it is the largest scare so far. A large and long-term follow-up study is necessary to solidate the clinical values. Third, we only measured plasma MIF levels in a small portion of study participants which may also limit the generalisation of our findings.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that MIF gene rs755622 variant with CC genotype and C allele is associated with increased risk of ACS. Identification of this MIF gene polymorphism may help for predicting the risk of ACS.
