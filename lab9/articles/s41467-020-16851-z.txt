Meningeal lymphatics clear erythrocytes that arise from subarachnoid hemorrhage
Extravasated erythrocytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) critically contribute to the pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Meningeal lymphatics have been reported to drain macromolecules and immune cells from CSF into cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). However, whether meningeal lymphatics are involved in clearing extravasated erythrocytes in CSF after SAH remains unclear. Here we show that a markedly higher number of erythrocytes are accumulated in the lymphatics of CLNs and meningeal lymphatics after SAH. When the meningeal lymphatics are depleted in a mouse model of SAH, the degree of erythrocyte aggregation in CLNs is significantly lower, while the associated neuroinflammation and the neurologic deficits are dramatically exacerbated. In addition, during SAH lymph flow is increased but without significant lymphangiogenesis and lymphangiectasia. Taken together, this work demonstrates that the meningeal lymphatics drain extravasated erythrocytes from CSF into CLNs after SAH, while suggesting that modulating this draining may offer therapeutic approaches to alleviate SAH severity.
As estimated by Global Burden of Diseases (GBD 2016), stroke is the second leading cause of death1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) contributes to only 5% of the cases of stroke2, but it occurs at a fairly young age and is associated with a high degree of mortality (in the range of 50%)3. Thus SAH is a large burden on society. The progression of SAH includes early brain injury that appears the first 3 days after injury, followed by delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) 3–4 days after injury, which reaches the highest incidence and severity 6–8 days after SAH4. As vasospasm, microthrombosis, and neuroinflammation contribute greatly to the DCI and clinical prognosis, pharmacological approaches to treat this pathology have been focused on preventing vasospasm, microclot formation, and anti-inflammation for decades; however, to date, few agents have been found to exert beneficial effects on patient outcomes5,6. The pathologies of SAH are caused by the extravasated blood presenting in the subarachnoid space (SAS). Thus a better understanding of extravasated blood clearance may help in the development of effective therapeutic approaches. When a SAH attack occurs, blood releases into the SAS, leading immediately to clot formation, which disappear within 2–3 days7,8. To date, clot lysis and phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils were considered as ways to clear the extravasated blood and the subsequent clots in the SAS9,10. However, the mechanism(s) by which extravasated blood is cleared is still unclear.
Recently, lymphatic vessels have been rediscovered and characterized in the meninges surrounding the central nervous system11,12. These lymphatics are responsible for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) macromolecules and immune cells to the cervical lymph nodes (CLNs)13,14. Meningeal lymphatics aid in the clearance of amyloid-beta in aged mice and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, and the augmentation of meningeal lymphatic function alleviates age-associated cognitive impairment13,15,16,17. But in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model the ablation of meningeal lymphatics or inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) diminished the EAE severity and the inflammatory response of brain-reactive T cells14,18. Thus the meningeal lymphatics may play different roles in different neurological diseases. Embryonic mesenteric lymphatic vessels have recently been shown to clear extravascular red blood cells (RBCs) leaking from the adjacent developmental vascular remodeling, suggesting that the lymphatic system has the potential to clear the erythrocytes in interstitial fluid19. But, as noted above, while meningeal lymphatics drain immune cells and macromolecules from CSF, it is still unclear whether they clear the extravasated blood after SAH.
Here we report that the extravasated blood is aggregated in CLNs, and the erythrocytes are accumulated in the lymphatics of CLNs inside and around meningeal lymphatic vessels for 4 h after SAH. We use CFSE (5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) to label erythrocytes ex vivo and inject them into the cisterna magna and demonstrate that the labeled erythrocytes are also evident in the lymphatics of CLNs and meningeal lymphatics. When we ablate meningeal lymphatics by photoconverted visudyne, RBC drainage into CLNs is significantly reduced, while the neuroinflammation and the neurological deficits associated with SAH are exacerbated. We further block VEGFR3 and also observe a worse brain injury during SAH. We examine the structure and functional characteristics of meningeal lymphatics during neuroinflammation and find the lymph flow is augmented but lymphangiogenesis and expansion are not pronounced. Our findings demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics participate in the drainage of RBCs into CLNs during the very early stage of SAH and may be a potent target in the treatment of this pathology.
Tracers, proteins, and labeled T cells injected into the brain or CSF are found in CLNs, indicating the drainage function by meningeal lymphatics14,20. To explore whether the erythrocytes released into the CSF, a condition called SAH, are drained to CLNs via the meningeal lymphatics, we injected autologous blood into the cisterna magna of mouse. Four hours later, we observed that the deep CLNs (dCLNs) and mandibular LNs were infused with blood, while no evidence of blood was observed in the saline-injected and control groups (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The data also suggest that the superficial parotid LNs, though located in the superficial anterior neck, did not drain the CSF erythrocytes, and there is no drainage of the axillary, the brachial, and the tracheobronchal LNs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Next, we used anti-Ter119 antibody to label erythrocytes and anti-Lyve-1 antibody to visualize the lymphatics of CLNs. The number of Ter119-positive erythrocytes in the Lyve-1-positive lymphatic sinus was significantly greater in the SAH group when compared with the saline and control groups for both types of CLNs (for the comparison of dCLNs, P = 0.002, Con vs SAH, P = 0.0063, saline vs SAH, Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). We found that the Ter119-positive cells were distributed mainly in the Lyve-1-positive lymphatic sinus of CLNs.

To determine whether the erythrocytes are drained to CLNs via the meningeal lymphatics, we isolated the meninges and stained the lymphatic vessels with antibodies. Erythrocytes were observed to accumulate around and inside of meningeal lymphatics at 4 h post-induction of SAH, while erythrocytes were not seen significantly entering into the lymphatics of the control and saline-injected groups (P < 0.0001, Con vs SAH; P < 0.0001, saline vs SAH; Fig. 1d, e). The corresponding orthogonal view (Supplementary Fig. 2) showed the erythrocytes co-localizing with Lyve-1-positive lymphatic endothelial cells, suggesting that these cells were drained via the meningeal lymphatic vessels. The identification of meningeal lymphatics was further confirmed by co-labeling them with other classical lymphatic endothelial cell markers including podoplanin (PDPN) and Prox1 with lyve-1, and the erythrocytes also showed accumulation into meningeal lymphatics (Fig. 1f). Morphologically intact erythrocytes and clusters of degraded membranes were seen at the same time in the lymphatics of CLNs and meninges (Fig. 1b, d), though it is not clear whether the erythrocytes were broken down before transportation by the lymphatics or after. But the data suggest that at least some erythrocytes were drained into CLNs before degradation.
To further confirm that the erythrocytes in meningeal lymphatics and CLNs were drained from exogenous injection, we labeled erythrocytes with CFSE in vitro and then injected them into the cisterna magna. Four hours later, the labeled erythrocytes also showed similar accumulation in the meningeal lymphatics (P < 0.0001, Fig. 2a, b), dCLNs (P = 0.0006, Fig. 2c, e), and mandibular LNs (P = 0.0207, Fig. 2d, e), while the saline-treated group did not show any evidence of CFSE-labeled erythrocytes.

To further verify whether meningeal lymphatic vessels serve as the route for the drainage of erythrocytes from the CSF into the CLNs, we ablated meningeal lymphatic vessels by injecting visudyne into the cisterna magna and photoconverted it by laser light. After 7 days of ablation, lymphatic coverage of the transverse sinus (P < 0.0001, Con vs Laser + Visudyne; P < 0.0001, Laser vs Laser + Visudyne; P < 0.0001, Visudyne vs Laser + Visudyne; Fig. 3a, b) and the superior sagittal sinus were notably lower (P < 0.0001, Con vs Laser+Visudyne; P = 0.0007, Laser vs Laser + Visudyne; P = 0.0003, Visudyne vs Laser + Visudyne; Fig. 3c). No difference in cerebral blood flow was observed between control mice and the Laser + Visudyne group (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). The coverage of blood vasculature on the transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus were not altered in the Visudyne-photoconverted group compared with Laser only or Visudyne only group (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).

On the seventh day after the ablation of the meningeal lymphatics, we induced SAH. After 4 h of SAH, blood infusion into the dCLNs and mandibular LNs were significantly lower in the mice with impaired meningeal lymphatics compared to the Laser only and the Visudyne only groups (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). And the number of Ter119-labeled erythrocytes was markedly lower in the dCLNs (P = 0.0013, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.0060, V + SAH vs L + V + SAH; Fig. 3e, f) and mandibular LNs (Supplementary Fig. 3g, h) of the lymphatic-ablation group. In general, blood is released into the SAS when SAH occurs and is cleared within 2–3 days7,8. But we found that clot clearance was blocked when the meningeal lymphatics were ablated as clots persisted in the brain until 7 days after the induction of SAH in the Laser + Visudyne group (Fig. 3g).
Neuroinflammation is prominent in SAH, leading to cerebral cell damage and vasospasm21. Microglia are resident brain macrophages, can be activated in SAH, and can display either classical pro-inflammatory phenotype or alternative anti-inflammatory phenotype polarization22. We hypothesized that, after ablation of meningeal lymphatics, the microglia activation would be worsened owing to the prolonged exposure to erythrocytes degradants. We thus performed whole-brain flow cytometry to determine the ratio of CD16/32-posititive pro-inflammatory microglia and CD206-positive anti-inflammatory microglia. For these measurements, CD11b+CD45low cell populations were gated as myeloid lineage cells including microglia, in which the CD16/32 was used as a marker for cells with pro-inflammatory phenotype and CD206 was used as a marker for cells with anti-inflammatory phenotype. The gating strategy is shown in Fig. 4a. Compared with SAH mice with intact lymphatics (SAH only, L + SAH and V + SAH group), SAH mice with lymphatic ablation (L + V + SAH group) showed a significantly greater percentage of CD16/32+CD206− microglia (P < 0.0001 SAH/L + SAH/V + SAH vs L + V + SAH, Fig. 4b, c) and a lower percentage of CD206+CD16/32− microglia (P = 0.0146, SAH vs L + V + SAH; P < 0.0001, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH Fig. 4b, d). When compared with the Laser + Visudyne group, the degree of activated microglia polarized to a pro-inflammatory phenotype was markedly greater after SAH as evidenced by an increased ratio of CD16/32+CD206− subsets and decreased ratio of CD206+CD16/32− cells. (P < 0.0001, L + V vs L + V + SAH for CD16/32+CD206− and P = 0.0086, L + V vs L + V + SAH for CD206+CD16/32−, Fig. 4c, d). The percentages of CD16/32 and CD206 double-positive cells, an intermediate state of polarization, and difference were only observed in the comparison between V + SAH and L + V + SAH groups (P = 0.025, Fig. 4e).

To assess the impact of the ablation of meningeal lymphatics on neurological function of the mice with SAH, we applied the open field test to evaluate the exploratory behavior of mice. SAH mice in the lymphatic-ablated group showed a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in the center and the number of entrances into the center compared to the non-ablated SAH mice (P = 0.0194, SAH vs L + V + SAH, P = 0.0053, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.009, V + SAH vs L + V + SAH, Fig. 4f, P < 0.0001, SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.0001, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.0018, V + SAH vs L + V + SAH; Fig. 4g). We also used a Y-maze test to evaluate the short-term working memory of the SAH model. We found that the SAH mice with ablated meningeal lymphatics were more vulnerable than the mice with intact lymphatics, as demonstrated by the percentage of time spent in the novel arm (NA) (P = 0.0006, SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.003, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH, Fig. 4h) and the number of entrances into the NA (P < 0.0001, SAH vs L + V + SAH; P < 0.0001, L + SAH vs L + V + SAH; P = 0.0338, V + SAH vs L + V + SAH, Fig. 4i). When compared with the mice only treated with photoconverted visudyne, the mice accompanied with SAH showed worse performance in both the open field (P = 0.0138, time spent in the center; P = 0.0141, number of entries into the center; L + V vs L + V + SAH, Fig. 4f, g) and the Y-maze test (P = 0.0198, time spent in the NA arm; P = 0.0303, number of entries into the NA arm, Fig. 4h, i).
Meningeal lymphatics maintain the potential to grow or regress in adults13,18. To further confirm the lack of integrity of meningeal lymphatics resulting in unfavorable outcomes in SAH, we inhibited VEGFR3, a tyrosine kinase receptor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, with MAZ51, a chemical inhibitor of VEGFR3 with proven effectiveness in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis18. MAZ51 was given intraperitoneally for 30 days (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, meningeal lymphatics underwent regression after treatment with MAZ51, as evidenced by a reduction in the lyve-1-positive area in both the transverse and superior sagittal sinuses (Fig. 5c). We observed no change in cerebral blood flow (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) and of CD31-positive blood vasculature area of the sinuses (Supplementary Fig. 3i–j).

On the 30th day after treatment, vehicle- and MAZ51-treated mice were injected autologous blood or saline. Microglia activation was also detected by flow cytometry (the general gating strategy is shown in Fig. 5d). As our data show, the percentage of CD16/32+CD206− pro-inflammatory microglia was increased after SAH induction (P = 0.0139, Vehicle + Sham vs Vehicle + SAH; P < 0.0001, MAZ51 + Sham vs MAZ51 + SAH, Fig. 5e, f), but the proportion of activated microglia polarized to CD16/32+CD206− phenotype were greater in the mice with meningeal lymphatic regression (P < 0.0001, Vehicle + SAH vs MAZ51 + SAH, Fig. 5f). The percentage of CD206+CD16/32− anti-inflammatory microglia was not markedly affected by SAH or MAZ51 induction but significantly reduced after SAH + MAZ51 treatment (P = 0.0233, MAZ51 + SAH vs Vehicle + Sham) (Fig. 5g). For the cell population characterized by CD16/32+CD206+, no statistical significance was observed (Fig. 5h). These results were consistent with the above findings, indicating that the deterioration of the meningeal lymphatic vessels leads to further aggravation of neuroinflammation caused by SAH.
To validate the regression of meningeal lymphatics resulting in worse neurological outcomes after SAH, we performed the behavioral tests on MAZ51-induced lymphatic regression mice. The exploratory behavior and short-term working memory were assessed by open field test and Y-maze test, respectively. Mice with degenerated meningeal lymphatics spent less time in the center after SAH (P = 0.0111, Vehicle + SAH vs MAZ51 + SAH, Fig. 5i) but did not show any difference in the number of entries into the center (Fig. 5j). The deficits of short-term working memory after SAH also worsened in mice treated with MAZ51, represented by less time spent in the NA (P = 0.0001, MAZ51 + Sham vs MAZ51 + SAH, Fig. 5k) and the number of entries into the NA (P = 0.0037, MAZ51 + Sham vs MAZ51 + SAH; P = 0.0221, Vehicle + SAH vs MAZ51 + SAH, Fig. 5l).
It has been reported that during acute inflammation, such as in intestinal inflammation, colitis, endocarditis, and rheumatoid arthritis, lymphatic flow and lymphangiogenesis are increased in the local peripheral lymphatic vessels, which is a mechanism for the body to reduce inflammation and edema23,24,25,26,27,28. To explore whether the neuroinflammation following SAH affects the function of the meningeal lymphatic vessels, we injected AF488-conjugated anti-Lyve-1 or fluorescent microbeads into the cisterna magna at day 7 after induction of SAH or saline injection. After 30 min, meninges were harvested and stained for Lyve-1 using AF555-conjugated secondary antibody. The percentage of meningeal lymphatics labeled by AF488-anti-Lyve-1 antibody (intracisterna magna (i.c.m.)) indicates the speed of meningeal lymphatic flow. A significantly greater percentage of meningeal lymphatics labeled by AF488 anti-Lyve-1 (i.c.m.) was seen in the SAH group vs the controls (P = 0.0122, Con vs SAH; P = 0.0303, Saline vs SAH; Fig. 6a–c), and all the lymphatics labeled by injected antibody were seen on the transverse sinus. A greater percentage of lymphatics labeled by AF488 anti-Lyve-1 (i.c.m.) also could be seen in dCLNs in the SAH group vs controls (P = 0.0183, Con vs SAH; P = 0.0181, saline vs SAH; Fig. 6d, e). Similarly, 2 h after fluorescent microbead injection, the bead coverage in dCLNs was significantly higher in the SAH group vs the controls (P = 0.0004, Con vs SAH; P = 0.0251, saline vs SAH; Fig. 6f–h). In addition, the higher contraction frequency of mandibular afferent lymphatic vessels was detected in the SAH group than that in the saline group (P = 0.0261, Fig. 6i, j).

To investigate whether the SAH process affects growth and expansion of the meningeal lymphatic vessels, we divided the meningeal lymphatics on the transverse sinus into eight different segments and measured the diameter and branching of each segment. Although we found significant dilation of vessel diameter (Fig. 7a, b) and a greater number of branches (Fig. 7a, c) in some segments in the SAH group, the lymphatic vessel area in the transverse sinus and the superior sagittal sinus did not change (Fig. 7d, e). Thus we conclude that lymphangiogenesis and lymphangiectasia of the meningeal lymphatics did not significantly alter at 7 days post-induction of SAH.

SAH most commonly occurs due to the rupture of an aneurysm in the cerebral artery, releasing blood into the SAS and resulting in a series of early neurological complications and DCI. Understanding the process by which meningeal lymphatics drain fluid, macromolecules and immune cells from the CSF has shed a light on the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic brain injury in past 5 years13,14,16,18,29,30. However, whether the extravasated erythrocytes released into the CSF during SAH can be removed by meningeal lymphatics remains unclear. Here we show that the extravasated erythrocytes in the SAS are drained into dCLNs and mandibular LNs through the meningeal lymphatics and that the depletion of meningeal lymphatics blocks the clearance of extravasated blood.
During SAH, blood pours into the SAS, where erythrocytes break down and release hemoglobin (Hgb) and its products that contribute to brain injury31,32. Previous studies report that extravasated erythrocytes and their degradation products in the SAS can be cleared via mechanisms of clot lysis or phagocytosis7,9,10,33. With the upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in cerebral blood vessel endothelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils enter the SAS and then phagocytose extravasated erythrocytes and Hgb34,35,36. It is proposed that macrophages and neutrophils are trapped in the SAS after phagocytosis of extravasated erythrocytes and Hgb, which then die and are degranulated within 2–4 days33,35. However, the structure and function of meningeal lymphatics have been defined recently11,12. Furthermore, microglia also play a role to clear in SAH by expressing heme oxygenase-137. Microglial activation and monocyte infiltration are observed 24 and 72 h after SAH, respectively38. Here we show that erythrocytes can be detected in the CLNs (dCLNs and mandibular LNs) and meningeal lymphatics at 4 h post SAH, a time much early than macrophage/microglia-mediated clearance. These findings reveal that the extravasated erythrocytes can be drained into CLNs before being degraded into Hgb or phagocytosed by macrophages and neutrophils, at least in the very early stages of SAH (4 h after SAH in this study). Meanwhile, we found here that the depletion of meningeal lymphatics significantly blocked the drainage of extravasated erythrocytes into CLNs, demonstrating that meningeal lymphatics serve as the route of draining for erythrocytes into the CLNs. The blood clots were observed in the brain of SAH mice with ablated lymphatics indicating that the clot clearance may be affected by the reduced cerebral lymphatic drainage. As CSF flow is not unidirectional, ventricular blood presenting in some acute SAH is proposed that is refluxed from cisternal hemorrhage and not indicative of primary ventricle bleeding39,40. Thus we considered that the clots on the pons and medulla in this study may result from the ventricular blood refluxed from SAS. There are several potential routes of extravasated blood clearance as discussed above. Different routes may participate in different phases of SAH, for example, before and after the degradation of erythrocytes. Great effort should be made in the future to clarify the kinetics and relative contribution of each of these pathways of extravasated erythrocyte clearance.
This study reveals a lymphatic route for clearing extravasated erythrocytes in SAH; however, the mechanism by which extravasated erythrocytes enter the meningeal lymphatics is still unclear. T cells and dendritic cells enter into and migrate through the meningeal lymphatics and peripheral lymphatic system via the C-C chemokine motif receptor 7–C-C chemokine motif ligand 21 pathway14,18,41,42. Macromolecules can be endocytosed by brain lymphatic endothelial cells in zebrafish43. Fluids and solutes diffuse into the peripheral lymphatic lumen due to the pressure difference between that of the interstitial fluid and the lumen44, while chylomicron uptake into lacteals occurs by active transport vesicles through lymphatic endothelial cells45,46. Little is known about the mechanism of extravasated erythrocytes entering meningeal lymphatics, but the known ways by which immune cells and macromolecules enter into the lymphatic lumen may provide some hints for future research.
Neuroinflammation that occurs as a result of SAH is caused by the accumulation of erythrocyte degradation products, including Hgb, methemoglobin, heme, and hemin in the SAS. Microglia are activated and accumulated in the brain accompanied by upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. These inflammatory factors contribute to the neuronal cell death and secondary brain injury after SAH38,47,48,49. In this study, we found that microglial activation and polarization into a pro-inflammatory microglial cells in SAH are aggravated by the depletion of meningeal lymphatics. This exacerbation may have occurred because the extravasated erythrocytes were trapped in the SAS, thus increasing the accumulation of Hgb and its products and prolonging brain exposure to these degradation products. A previous study reported that the subarachnoid clot volume and spontaneous clearance rate are closely related to vasospasm8. Thus promoting the clearance of subarachnoid erythrocytes via accelerating meningeal lymphatic flow may be a potential therapy for the pathologies associated with SAH.
The enhancement of lymphatic draining function, lymphangiogenesis, and lymphangiectasia are commonly observed in peripheral acute inflammation, including arthritis, bacterial keratitis, and colitis50,51,52, with the enhanced lymphatic flow and lymphangiogenesis reducing the local inflammation and edema. The overexpression of VEGF-C by viral infection or local injection has been shown to ameliorate, while the blockade of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway exacerbates, inflammation52,53,54,55,56. Increasing meningeal lymphatic drainage was observed at day 7 of SAH in this study; however, lymphatic expansion and growth were not pronounced. These results are in consistent with previous reports that the morphology of meningeal lymphatics did not change in EAE-associated neuroinflammation14,18. Meningeal lymphatics may have a limited growth capability when exposed to neuroinflammation. Further research is needed to determine whether modulating lymphangiogenesis by overexpression of VEGF-C or other means affects SAH induced-neuroinflammation.
In summary, we show that extravasated erythrocytes in the SAS are drained into CLNs through meningeal lymphatics during SAH. This study adds insight into the extravasated erythrocyte clearance pathway that occurs during the very early stages of SAH and provides a possible therapeutic avenue for its treatment, as well as possibly other types of intracranial hemorrhage.
