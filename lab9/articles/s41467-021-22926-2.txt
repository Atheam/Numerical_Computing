COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a global public health crisis with enormous economic consequences. Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can provide an important treatment option to fight COVID-19, especially for the most vulnerable populations. In this work, potent antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were identified from COVID-19 convalescent patients. Among them, P4A1 interacts directly with and covers majority of the Receptor Binding Motif of the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain, shown by high-resolution complex structure analysis. We further demonstrate the binding and neutralizing activities of P4A1 against wild type and mutant Spike proteins or pseudoviruses. P4A1 was subsequently engineered to reduce the potential risk for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of infection and to extend its half-life. The engineered antibody exhibits an optimized pharmacokinetic and safety profile, and it results in complete viral clearance in a rhesus monkey model of COVID-19 following a single injection. These data suggest its potential against SARS-CoV-2 related diseases.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently emerged throughout the world as the largest pandemic of the twenty-first century, with more than 123 million confirmed cases and 2.7 million deaths worldwide as of March 22, 2021. A public health crisis on such a scale requires a range of effective prophylactic and treatment options. Neutralizing antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike (S) protein become one of the promising options to treat and prevent COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the most vulnerable population including seniors, patients with underlying conditions such as immune deficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and kidney diseases. Like other Class I fusion proteins, the S glycoprotein forms homotrimers on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle, mediates recognition of and binding to the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), and then induces the virus–host cell membrane fusion. Therefore, S glycoprotein is regarded as the primary target for interfering with the virus entry process1. A number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently under development or already in use have shown effectiveness in inducing anti-viral antibodies and preventing incidence and severity of COVID-192,3,4,5. However, the success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ultimately hinges on the quality and longevity of the induced immune responses, particularly in elderly or individuals with pre-existing conditions, and on the acceptance of vaccination by the general public. Moreover, recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection6,7 in patients pose a further challenge to the vaccine approach.
To date, significant efforts have been made to the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using various platforms, including antibody discovery from SARS-CoV8,9 or SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, from humanized mice19,20, and from phage libraries21,22. As a result of these efforts, several leading antibodies have entered the clinical stage with anti-viral efficacy demonstrated in mild-moderate COVID-19 patients23. Of note, a major concern for the development of these neutralizing antibody therapies is the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection24,25, as previously reported in dengue26 and SARS-CoV27 infections. The risk of ADE was raised as a concern for SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures recently as well18,28. Another aspect to consider for an effective antibody therapy is the ability to target evolving mutated virus. By analyzing all reported sequences from GISAID (gisaid.org) from December 24, 2019 to December 13, 2020 with the LANL pipeline29, mutations (with frequency ≥0.3% for non-ACE2 interface residues and ≥0.1% for ACE2 interface residues) to about 172 residues in the Spike protein have been identified.
Here in this work, we isolate and identify neutralizing antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein from COVID-19 convalescent patients; one of the best RBD-specific antibodies, P4A1, shows potent neutralizing activities with nanomolar IC50. The high-resolution complex structure analysis reveals its binding epitope, which covers majority of the binding site of hACE2. Importantly, P4A1 was subsequently engineered and results in an optimized pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile. The effectiveness of the engineered antibody P4A1–2A was further examined in a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in rhesus macaques, which demonstrate potent anti-viral efficacy following a single injection. Overall, these data suggest its potential for clinical development against SARS-CoV-2-related diseases.
To identify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients, we utilized the single-cell B-cell receptor sequencing approach. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were isolated from two convalescent patients with the highest titer against S protein (Patient 4 and Patient 20) among 23 patients studied (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding B cells were enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using biotinylated S protein-conjugated magnetic beads as described in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1c, d. Among the sequenced antibodies, P4A1, P20A2, and P20A3 were shown to bind to the S1 subunit with sub-to-nM EC50s, but they did not bind to the S2 subunit, while blocking the binding of the S1 subunit to ACE2-expressing cells with IC50 values in the nM range (Fig. 1a). P4A1, P20A2, and P20A3 neutralized the live SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with 50% neutralization dose (ND50) values of 5.212, 43.79, and 29.03 nM, respectively (Fig. 1b). According to analysis based on the ImmunoGenetics database, the IGHV germline origin of antibody P4A1 belonged to IGHV3–53, which is one of the most frequent used germline families after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients17,30 (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5a).

Upper panels: binding of antibodies to the full-length S protein, S1 protein, and S2 protein was evaluated by ELISA (in duplicates with symbols show each of the replicates). Lower left panel: blockage of the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein to Vero E6 cells by antibodies evaluated by flow cytometry (data in singleton). Lower middle panel: pseudovirus neutralization assay in Huh-7 cells (data in singleton). Lower right panel: in triplicates with symbols show each of the triplicates and SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralization assay. All experiments were repeated at least two more times (except S2 binding that was repeated one more time) with similar results. b Images of Vero E6 cell-infected SARS-CoV-2 treated with antibodies of different concentrations. Green (stained with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody) indicates viral infected cells and blue (Hoechst 33258) represents cell nuclei. Experiment was performed in triplicates and repeated two more times with similar results.
To gain insight into the structural basis for the blocking and neutralizing mechanism of P4A1, the structure of the antibody Fab/Spike-RBD complex was resolved by X-ray crystallography at the resolution of 2.1 Å (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Three heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions (HCDRs), two light-chain complementarity-determining regions (LCDRs), together with weak interaction from the light-chain framework region 3 constitute the interaction network with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). The buried surface area (BSA) from the heavy-chain interaction in P4A1 (781 Å2) is relatively larger compared to reported neutralizing antibodies including B38 (713 Å2)17, CB6 (734 Å2)18, CC12.1 (723 Å2), and CC12.3 (698 Å2)16 (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the BSA from the light chain varies significantly, with P4A1 (414.6 Å2) compared to B38 (495 Å2)17, CB6 (334 Å2)18, CC12.1 (566 Å2), and CC12.3 (176 Å2)16 (Supplementary Table 3). Specifically, the interaction network is mainly contributed by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction. For the heavy chain, P4A1 HCDR1 and HCDR2 share similar interaction patterns with SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD as CC12.1 and CC12.3, while these antibodies differ in their HCDR3 sequence, with Q100, E101 forming a hydrogen bond with K417 and Y453, and the side chain of L102 inserting into the hydrophobic cavity formed by L485, F456, and Y489 (Fig. 2c, upper panel). For the light chain, the hydrogen bond network is mediated by G28, S30, S31, W32 in LCDR1 with T500, N501, G502, Q498, Y449, and G496; and E90, N92, S93 in LCDR3 with Y505, and R403 (Fig. 2c, lower panel). It is worth noting that the water molecule plays a more important role for the light chain than it does for the heavy chain.

The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is colored in gray and displayed in surface representation. b The epitope of P4A1 shown in surface representation. The CDR loops of heavy chain (HCDR) and light chain (LCDR) are colored in purple and magenta, respectively. The epitopes from the heavy chain and light chain are colored in slate blue and salmon red, respectively. The only residue K417, which contacts with both heavy chain and light chain, is colored in pink. The light-chain frame region 3 (LFR3) is colored in orange. The identical residues on RBD shared in P4A1 and hACE2 binding are labeled in red. The residues are numbered according to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. c The detailed interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD with HCDR, LCDR, and LFR3. The residues are shown in sticks with identical colors to (b).
P4A1 binds to the epitope on the Spike protein that locates directly at the receptor-binding motif region of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, hence inducing steric hindrance to the binding of the Spike protein to receptor hACE2 (Fig. 2a). Except for residues G446 and Y449, 15 of the 17 residues identified as SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-hACE2 binding sites1 are within the P4A1-targeting epitope using the distance of <4 Å as the cutoff, while Y449 is exactly 4 Å from P4A1 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). This represents one of the most extensive coverages to date by any antibody of residues involved in the Spike-hACE2 interaction and may explain the potent neutralization activity of P4A1. As high coverage of RBD residues involved in hACE2 binding and large BSAs are also observed in other neutralizing antibodies with IGVH3–53 usage including B3817 and CC12.1, CC12.316, this may represent a class effect of the IGVH3–53 antibody family.
With the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, the circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutations are subjected to strong selection to maximize the virus infection rate, some virus variant will possibly decrease its sensitivity to certain antibodies. It has been reported that single residue mutations are sufficient for the viral escape from certain neutralizing antibodies31,32. To explore whether P4A1 was effective against different SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutants, we tested its binding ability to 17 different RBD and 2 S1 mutants, including the N439K, Y453F, S477N, N501Y RBD variants and D614G and A222V/D614G S1 variants that represent variants most frequently observed in the clinic. In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6a) or ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 6b) analyses, the binding of P4A1 with the variants was similar to binding with the wild-type RBD or S1 protein with similar affinities or EC50 values except K417N variants. P4A1 also showed potent neutralization activities against pseudoviruses expressing wild-type or D614G, V367F, D364Y, or W436R variants of the Spike protein with similar IC50s (Fig. 3b).

To maximize its clinical utility, P4A1 was further engineered as an IgG4 antibody (named as P4A1–2A) to reduce the risks of Fcγ- or complement-receptor-mediated ADE, and it was further modified to mitigate Fab-arm exchange33, and to extend antibody half-life34. Consistent with its isotype and Fc engineering, P4A1–2A displayed 4–81-fold decrease in binding affinity to different FcγRs, no binding to complement C1q, and enhanced affinity for FcRn when compared to its IgG1 form P4A1 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7). The effect of enhanced FcRn binding is further validated by the longer serum half-life in cynomolgus monkey (Supplementary Fig. 7). The prolonged half-life is highly desired, as it will be beneficial for long-term protection in individuals at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic. Furthermore, the safety of P4A1–2A was demonstrated in a GLP toxicology study where cynomolgus monkeys were treated with 2 weekly intravenous (i.v.) infusions of up to 300 mg/kg/dose and no treatment-related adverse effects were observed in any of the tests performed, including cytokine levels, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ at different time points (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Besides, no tissue cross-reactivity was observed for 37 different normal human tissues (Supplementary Fig. 9b).
The effectiveness of the engineered antibody was examined in a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in rhesus macaques (Fig. 4a). This and other NHP SARS-CoV-2 infection models recapitulate characteristics of COVID-191,35,36,37,38,39 and were used for evaluating the efficacy of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies for COVID-1918,40,41,42,43. In the study, Isotype control or P4A1–2A were administered in a single i.v. infusion 1 day after intra-tracheal virus inoculation at 1 × 105 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50). Consistent with the previous report1, in the isotype control (50 mg/kg) group, viral load using oropharyngeal swabs was at a high level 1 day post infection (d.p.i.), showing the colonization of virus, decreased 2 d.p.i., suggesting viral distribution, increased 3–4 d.p.i. and maintained at high level until euthanization, indicating viral replication. Importantly, in three out of three (50 mg/kg) and two out of three (10 mg/kg) P4A1-2A-treated animals, the viral load dropped continuously to a level near or below the detection limit, and viral elimination occurred on 4–5 d.p.i., indicating effective blocking of viral propagation by P4A1–2A (Fig. 4b).
a Experimental design for therapeutic testing of P4A1–2A in the rhesus macaque (n = 3/group). b Viral load in oropharyngeal swabs tested by RT-qPCR was monitored for 7 days. c Viral load in the respiratory tissues (including trachea, left and right bronchus, and all six lung lobes) collected at necropsy on 7 days post infection (d.p.i., n = 1/group) was tested by RT-qPCR. d Representative images of histopathology in lung tissue from isotype control or P4A1–2A 50 mg/kg treated animals (collected at 7 d.p.i., n = 1/group).
At necropsy, trachea, left and right bronchus, and different lung lobes were isolated, homogenized, and tested for viral load. In the isotype control treatment group, substantial viral load was detected in three, five, or six, respectively, out of the nine tissues examined (including consistent viral presence in trachea, left and right bronchus) in the three animals with moderate to severe lung lesions similar to a previous report1. In contrast, no viral load was detected 6 or 7 d.p.i. in any of the nine tissues examined and with mild to mild-moderate lung lesions in two animals treated with 50 mg/kg P4A1–2A. In the 10 mg/kg P4A1–2A-treated animals, virus was detected in only one of the nine tissues in the animal examined 7 d.p.i. and no viral RNA was detected in any of the lung tissues in all three animals (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 10). Statistical analysis was not performed due to the small number of animals per group (n = 3), animals euthanized on different days (n = 1/group/day) and biological differences within the groups observed.
These results represent similar or better anti-viral efficacy in the respiratory system than the currently reported antibodies18 with lower i.v. dose of neutralizing antibody used in similar NHP SARS-CoV-2 infection models. In addition to the efficacy of P4A1–2A, a potentially better distribution to the respiratory tract associated with the engineered IgG4 antibodies shown by previous work34 may contribute to the total viral clearance in some of the animals. These data demonstrate that P4A1–2A is effective in vivo despite reduced FcγR effector functions.
High affinity neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients may represent some of the most efficient anti-viral weapons contributing to patient recovery from viral infection. Given that not every COVID-19 patient is able to produce high-quality antibodies such as P4A1, this antibody along with antibody engineering to reduce potential safety concerns and to prolong the serum half-life may provide instant and durable protection for every individual, especially, for individuals at high risk of viral infection and/or developing severe diseases. Structural analysis demonstrates the molecular basis for the neutralizing mechanism of P4A1, whose epitope on S protein RBD includes most of the hACE2-binding residues, exhibiting potent anti-viral activities in vitro and in vivo. The broad coverage of hACE2 epitopes may contribute to the antibody’s effectiveness against viral mutants, based on activities against Spike protein mutants tested, including the most prevalent N439K, Y453F, S477N, and N501Y RBD variants and D614G, A222V/D614G S1 variants, with similar binding affinities, EC50 or IC50s compared to wild-type protein.
Most importantly, engineered IgG4 version of P4A1 (P4A1–2A) demonstrated anti-viral efficacy in rhesus macaque SARS-CoV-2 infection model, despite reduced Fc effector functions. It needs to be pointed out that the study was performed with relatively small sample size (n = 3/group). Despite this and the biological differences observed within the group, anti-viral efficacy was clearly demonstrated based on the following: (i) none of the three animals in the isotype control group showed signs of viral clearance during the study, while five out of the six P4A1–2A-treated (10 and 50 mg/kg) animals including all three animals treated with 50 mg/kg P4A1–2A showed viral clearance; (ii) viral RNA was detected in trachea, bronchus in all three isotype-control-treated animals, and in the lung lobes of two of these animals, while two animals treated with 50 mg/kg P4A1–2A were completely viral-free in all tissues tested; (iii) clear alleviation of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung pathological changes in the 50 mg/kg P4A1–2A group compared to isotype control group; (iv) dose dependency of anti-viral efficacy by P4A1–2A treatment: 50 mg/kg group showed better viral clearance and alleviation of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung pathological changes than 10 mg/kg group. In addition to rhesus macaque model reported in this work, more NHP COVID-19 animal models, such as those established in African green monkey35,36,37, cynomolgus macaques38,39, etc., have also been developed to reflect clinical symptoms and underlying etiopathogenesis similar to those in COVID-19 patients. These disease relevant models provide alternative possibilities if we are to explore additional prophylactic application for P4A1–2A. Ultimately, the anti-viral efficacy of the antibody remains to be tested in clinical setting.
With its potent anti-viral efficacy, prolonged half-life, and its potential for a broad spectrum of viral neutralization, P4A1–2A represents not only optimized therapeutic potency, but also offers an important prophylactic option complementary to vaccine approaches to safeguard the vulnerable populations. The comprehensive characterization of this antibody provides strong evidence for its promising potential to effectively treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans.
