Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods
#https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2013176
Household-level food spending data are not suitable for population-based studies of the economics of nutrition. This study compared three methods of deriving diet cost at the individual level.
Adult men and women (n=164) completed 4-day diet diaries and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Food expenditures over 4 weeks and supermarket prices for 384 foods were obtained. Diet costs (US$/day) were estimated using: (1) diet diaries and expenditures; (2) diet diaries and supermarket prices; and (3) FFQs and supermarket prices. Agreement between the three methods was assessed on the basis of Pearson correlations and limits of agreement. Income-related differences in diet costs were estimated using general linear models.
Diet diaries yielded mean (s.d.) diet costs of $10.04 (4.27) based on Method 1 and $8.28 (2.32) based on Method 2. FFQs yielded mean diet costs of $7.66 (2.72) based on Method 3. Correlations between energy intakes and costs were highest for Method 3 (r2=0.66), lower for Method 2 (r2=0.24) and lowest for Method 1 (r2=0.06). Cost estimates were significantly associated with household incomes.
The weak association between food expenditures and food intake using Method 1 makes it least suitable for diet and health research. However, merging supermarket food prices with standard dietary assessment tools can provide estimates of individual diet cost that are more closely associated with food consumed. The derivation of individual diet cost can provide insights into some of the economic determinants of food choice, diet quality and health.
The cost of a nutritious diet is an important and complex issue for public health.1, 2, 3 Real or perceived inability to afford healthful foods can be a barrier to dietary change.4, 5, 6 Lower-cost foods tend to be energy-dense but nutrient-poor.7, 8 Such foods are often consumed by groups of lower socioeconomic status (SES) who are also more likely to be obese.9, 10
Epidemiologic analyses have drawn a direct link between measures of diet quality and estimated diet cost.11, 12, 13, 14 However, studies on nutrition economics have been hampered by the lack of appropriate methods and tools.15 Studies on food purchases have typically dealt with food expenditures at the household level5, 10, 16 and could not provide individual estimates of food consumed. Although such data can be used to impute individual food expenditures, by dividing by the number of household members, they may be problematic if applied to individual level studies on diets and health. By contrast, most studies on diet and chronic diseases, always conducted at the individual level, provided no data on the cost of foods consumed.
Individual-level diet costs have been estimated by linking dietary intake data from 24 h recalls or diet diaries to national or local food prices.17, 18, 19 More typically, diet costs are estimated by linking prices to diet history or food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Following this approach, studies conducted in Europe,12, 14, 20 the USA11, 21, 22 and Japan13, 23, 24 have produced diet cost estimates based on fixed tables of food prices containing 57–384 foods. However, costs estimated from FFQs might not be directly comparable to those obtained with diet diaries. Furthermore, costs estimated using prevailing supermarket price data might not reflect the individual’s own food expenditures.
This study compared three different methods of estimating individual-level diet costs that were derived from: (1) 4-day diet diaries and individual food expenditures; (2) diet diaries and supermarket prices; and (3) FFQ data and supermarket prices. The three diet cost data sets were compared to each other, to estimated energy intakes and to self-reported household incomes.
The final analytic sample of 164 (103 women and 61 men) provided complete FFQ and diet diary data, all questionnaires and shopping and restaurant receipts over 4 weeks.
Mean age was 42.2 years for women and 38.0 years for men (range 25–65 years). Most men (92%) and most women (85%) had completed a bachelor’s degree or higher. A majority of women (60%) and half the men (51%) had annual household incomes of $55 000 and above. Most men (85%) and women (82%) identified themselves as white, with the rest being Asian or Pacific Islander and African American. Demographic and SES data are summarized in Table 1.
On the basis of diet diaries, mean (s.d.) intakes overall were 2134 (508) kcal/day (8.93 MJ), with a range of 1192–3796 kcal/day (5.0–15.9 MJ). Men consumed 2426 kcal/day (10.2 MJ) and women 1960 kcal/day (8.2 MJ). The FFQ showed a lower overall mean but more variance than the diet diary estimates. Average daily energy intake for the whole sample was 1894 (641) kcal/day (7.9 MJ) and intakes ranged from 689 to 4110 kcal/day (2.9–17.2 MJ). Men reported energy intakes of 2088 kcal/day (8.7 MJ) and women 1779 kcal/day (7.4 MJ).
Crude nutrient intakes from the two instruments are summarized in Table 2. As with energy intake, macronutrient intakes from 4-day diet diaries were generally higher than the estimates produced by the FFQ. However, for crude micronutrient intakes, estimates from diet diaries tended to be lower than those from the FFQ. Among both macronutrients and micronutrients, the magnitude of differences in estimated mean nutrient intake between the diet diaries and FFQs varied from as low as 2% for fiber (diet diary estimate higher) to 46% for magnesium (diet diary estimate lower). Pearson correlations for energy-adjusted nutrient intake estimates from the two instruments ranged from 0.27 (vitamin B1) to 0.7 (fiber).
Mean (s.d.) diet costs based on 4-day diet diaries and food expenditures (Method 1) were $10.04 (4.27)/day (range $2.09–24.90/day). Despite the difference in estimated energy intake between the two sexes, men and women spent a similar amount of money on food per day; $9.97/day versus $10.08/day, respectively. However, on a per-2000 kcal (8.38 MJ) basis expenditures were $8.37 for men and $10.47 for women. The overall energy-adjusted diet cost was $9.70 (4.06).
The top panel in Figure 1 shows the association between diet costs estimated using Method 1 and estimates of dietary energy for all 164 participants. Diet costs based on food expenditures showed much greater inter-subject variability than did energy intakes. Although food expenditures varied by more than 10-fold, energy varied only by a factor of four. Diet cost was only weakly associated with food intake, with dietary energy accounting for 6% of the variation in food expenditure.

Middle panel, Method 2 based on 4-day diet diaries linked to a database of supermarket prices. Bottom panel, Method 3 based on FFQ with the same food price database. Energy estimates were based on each corresponding instrument. Least squares regression indicated weakest association between cost and energy for Method 1 and strongest for Method 3.
Mean (s.d.) diet costs based on 4-day diet diaries and standard supermarket prices (Method 2) were estimated at $8.28 (2.32)/day. Relative to Method 1, the range was greatly reduced at $4.05–14.74/day. The estimated diet cost was higher for men ($8.59/day) than for women ($8.09/day) before adjusting for energy. Diet cost per 2000 kcal was $7.21 for men and $8.37 for women with an overall mean of $7.94 (2.19). Relative to Method 1, the association between diet cost and energy was stronger (r2=0.24; Figure 1, middle panel).
Mean (s.d.) diet costs based on FFQ data and standard supermarket prices (Method 3) were $7.66 (2.72) per day, ranging from $2.03 to $18.11/day. Diet cost was $8.12/day for men and 7.39/day for women. Diet cost per 2000 kcal was $7.73 for men and $8.44 for women with an overall mean of $8.19 (1.68). Figure 1 bottom panel shows that the association between diet cost and energy was robust (r2=0.66).
The association between diet costs estimated using Method 1 and those estimated using Method 3 was weak. Crude daily food expenditures were an average of 31% higher than diet costs estimated using Method 3. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two crude measures was 0.21 and limits of agreement analysis indicated a mean difference of $2.37/day (Method 1 higher) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference of $1.67, $3.08. The weakness of the association was partly attributed to differences in the energy estimates from the two instruments. Adjusting for energy based on residuals yielded a Pearson correlation of 0.30. Adjusting crude diet costs on a per-8.38 MJ (2000 kcal) basis narrowed the difference in estimated diet costs to 18% and yielded a correlation of 0.33 (Table 2).
By contrast, we found higher correlations between diet costs derived using Method 1 and Method 2. Method 1 and Method 2 shared the same instrument of dietary intake assessment, but differed in the use of actual food expenditures versus supermarket prices. The mean (95% CI) difference between the crude estimates was $1.76/day ($1.21, $2.31, Method 1 higher) and the Pearson correlation coefficient for energy-adjusted estimates was 0.49. Diet costs obtained using Methods 2 and 3 were also significantly correlated. Methods 2 and 3 used different methods of dietary intake assessment, but the same price database. The mean (95% CI) difference between the crude estimates was $0.62/day ($−0.16, $1.07, Method 2 higher) and the Pearson correlation coefficient for energy-adjusted estimates was 0.39. The comparison of the resulting three estimates of diet cost and the Pearson correlation of energy-adjusted estimates is illustrated in Figure 2.

Although all three estimates of diet cost showed positive associations with household income, an indicator of SES, the strength of the association was different for the three estimates. Figure 3 presents covariate-adjusted means and standard errors for each of the three measures of diet cost across four levels of household income. Diet cost estimates based on Method 1 showed the strongest gradient with income, with the highest income group showing a daily diet cost that was 34% higher than the daily costs for participants in the lowest income group (difference of $2.98/day, P=0.004). Method 2 showed a 16% difference between the highest and the lowest income groups ($1.24/day, P=0.015), whereas Method 3 showed a 15% difference ($1.08/day, P=0.007) between the highest and the lowest income groups.

Estimates of daily diet costs at the individual level can be obtained by joining dietary intake data with prevailing food price data, from local supermarkets, or individual price data, from each participant’s own food expenditures. The present goal was to test the performance of alternative methods, following the design of previous inter-method reliability and validity studies.26, 29, 30
Comparisons were therefore conducted both across and within two dietary assessment instruments: diet diaries (Methods 1 and 2) and FFQ (Method 3). In Method 3, FFQ data were combined with area food prices, a widely used approach internationally.11, 12, 13, 14 Method 2, combining 4-day diet diaries with area food prices, was similar to the approach used in earlier studies in Japan31 and Sweden19 that linked 4-day diaries to national and local food prices. A variation of this approach has been the application of national food prices to 24-h recalls of adults18 and children17 in the USA.
Method 1, which derived expenditures for food consumed, has to our knowledge not been previously reported and might be described as closest to a ‘true’ indication of diet cost. In fact, the present estimate of $10.04 was similar to the $10.12 per capita food expenditures imputed by the US Department of Agriculture using household food expenditure data for 2006.32 However, two factors limit the usefulness of Method 1 for diet and nutrition research. First, for reasons discussed below, this diet cost estimate showed little association with the total amount of food consumed (Figure 1, top panel), which would likely attenuate any association of diet cost with diet composition. Second, estimating individual diet costs by using individual food expenditures is highly labor intensive, requiring 4–8 h to link each coded 4-day diet diary to receipt data and adjust purchased products for edible portion.
Methods 2 and 3, which applied a standard database of supermarket prices, have parallels in nutritional epidemiology, where estimates of energy and nutrient intakes for individuals are derived from common nutrient composition tables. For example, the vitamin C content of fresh, raw apples consumed by participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is set at 4.6 mg per 100 g edible portion,33 regardless of the vitamin C content of the apples that were actually consumed. The addition of a price variable was analogous to the inclusion of new nutrient-based variables in the FFQ nutrient database.34
All three estimates of diet cost were positively and monotonically associated with household income, consistent with past studies on incomes and household food expenditures.5, 10, 35 Diet cost estimates based on expenditures (Method 1) were not only the highest but also showed the largest differences across income strata. It is likely that diet costs estimated using a standard prices database (Methods 2 and 3) underestimate the true differences in purchasing power across income groups.
A number of factors may have biased the results of this methodological study. First, analyses were based on a convenience sample of mostly white adults of higher SES, that although small, was similar in size to samples used in previous reliability studies of dietary assessment.26, 29, 30 The socioeconomic profile of the sample was one factor that made the present estimates of diet cost substantially higher than estimates based on a representative sample of adults in the USA: $7.94 per 2000 kcal (Method 2) versus $–5 per 2000 kcal in NHANES. Samples primarily composed of higher SES persons would have implications for bias in diet cost estimates using either Methods 2 or 3. Our analyses of all three measures of diet cost by household income (Figure 3) indicated that underestimation of food expenditures using either Methods 2 or 3 was greatest for higher-income people. Another consideration is that eligibility required either having primary or shared responsibility for food purchasing. Finally, following precedent,36 Methods 2 and 3 made the assumption that all foods were purchased at retail and prepared at home.
The home preparation assumption was one factor that led to systematically lower estimates in Methods 2 and 3 relative to Method 1, which accounted for away-from-home consumption. The costs of away-from-home foods reflect not only the cost of food and drink but also the cost of services provided.37 For instance, in Method 1, the cost of plain brewed coffee depended on whether it was prepared at home ($0.09/100 g) or purchased prepared from a coffee shop (>$1.67/100 g). By comparison, our standard database price for prepared coffee (applied to Methods 2 and 3) was $0.04/100 g. The use of standard prices (Methods 2 and 3) also ignored for the possibility that different participants may have paid different prices for the same foods, which can vary substantially by brand and by retail outlet.38 Furthermore, differences in diet cost estimates also were imposed by the inherent difference between the diet diary and FFQ.
