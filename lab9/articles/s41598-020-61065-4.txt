Digoxin-amiodarone Combination is Associated With Excess All-cause Mortality in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
Combination use of digoxin and other medications might lead to worse outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to investigate whether digoxin-amiodarone combination would lead to worse outcome than digoxin alone in patients with AF. Adult patients with AF and received digoxin treatment from random samples of 1,000,000 individuals covered by the National Health Insurance in Taiwan were included. Baseline characteristics including risk factors and medications were matched by propensity score (PS) in those with and without addition of amiodarone treatment. A total of 5,040 AF patients taking digoxin therapy was included. PS matching identified 1,473 patients receiving digoxin-amiodarone combination and 2,660 patients receiving digoxin with a median follow-up of 1,331 days. Digoxin-amiodarone combination was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.640, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.470–1.829, P < 0.001). The risk of mortality increased regardless of duration of combination. Risk of sudden cardiac death was not increased in the combination group (HR: 1.304, 95% CI: 1.049–1.622, P = 0.017). Death due to non-arrhythmic cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, and other vascular disease were higher in the combination group than the digoxin group. In conclusion, in patients with AF, digoxin-amiodarone combination therapy is associated with excess mortality than digoxin alone.
Digoxin is one of the oldest drugs in cardiovascular (CV) medicine, traditionally used in treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF)1, and one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in AF. In the Stroke Prevention using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation (SPOTIF) study, 53% of patients were taking digoxin2. Digoxin is effective for long-term rate control at rest through slowing down atrioventricular conduction3. However, from meta-analysis and cohort study, use of digoxin might be associated with excess mortality in AF patients2,4,5.
In clinical practice, digoxin is frequently used in combination with other drugs, and many drugs interact with digoxin6. This may cause serum digoxin concentration (SDC) to exceed its therapeutic range, and according to the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial7, higher SDC resulted in less neurohormonal-inhibiting properties and higher rate of CV and all-cause mortality. Therefore, when interpretation of harmful effect of digoxin, concomitant drugs in use and their interactions with digoxin should be taken into consideration.
Dronedarone and amiodarone are two frequently concomitantly used drugs for rhythm control in patients with AF8. In the Permanent Atrial Fibrillation Outcome Study Using Dronedarone on Top of Standard Therapy (PALLAS) trial, elevated SDC by dronedarone was demonstrated9, and further investigation disclosed the potential harm of increased sudden death when dronedarone was used concomitantly with digoxin. Digoxin-dronedarone combination was discouraged afterward8. Whether patients with AF receiving digoxin-amiodarone combination therapy were in similar risk was unknown.
In this study, we carried out a nation-wide, population-based study to examine whether digoxin-amiodarone combination therapy was associated with increased mortality compared to digoxin alone10. Its impact on risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) was also evaluated.
A total of 4,133 AF patients taking digoxin therapy was included as pre-matched population (Fig. 1). Among them, 2,660 patients received digoxin alone (the digoxin group), and 1,473 patients received digoxin-amiodarone combination (the combination group). Prevalence of DM (32.1% vs. 35.2%), hyperlipidemia (33.6% vs. 37.9%), CAD (55.3% vs. 58.9%), prior coronary revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.5%), old myocardial infarction (2.0% vs. 2.9%,), PAD (21.7% vs. 23.3%,), and VHD (7.9% vs. 9.8%,) were significantly higher in the combination group (Table 1). After PS match, mean age were 69 years old in both groups (Table 2). There is no difference in sex, prevalence of risk factors and comorbidities between the two groups. The absolute standardized differences of variables were all below 0.1 in the post-match population(Supplementary table 1 and supplementary figure 2).
The algorithm for enrollment of the study subjects.
All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the combination group (37.3% vs. 26.9%, P < 0.001). Death due to non-arrhythmic cardiac death (5.0% vs. 3.7%), other vascular disease (0.8% vs. 0.1%), respiratory disease (9.2% vs. 5.2%), and infectious disease (12.8% vs. 9.1%) occurred more often in the combination group than the digoxin group. The rate of SCD was similar between the two groups (6.7% and 5.9% for digoxin and combination group, respectively). There was a trend of increased SCD rate in combination group but did not reach statistical significance (8.2% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.068).
In the regression analysis (Table 3), two models were used to evaluate the HR of digoxin-amiodarone combination using digoxin treatment as reference. For all-cause mortality, the adjusted HR of digoxin-amiodarone combination was 1.768 with model 1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.590–1.967, P < 0.001) and 1.640 with model 2 (95% CI = 1.303–1.736, P < 0.001). The HR remained significant in the sensitivity analysis (HR 1.770, 95% CI = 1.496–20.94, P < 0.001) For SCD, the adjusted HR were 1.031 (95% CI = 0.800–1.329, P = 0.813) with model 1, and 0.970 (95% CI = 0.748–1.258, P = 0.817) with model 2. The Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that the combination group had worse survival than the digoxin group, but there is no difference between the two groups regarding SCD-free survival (Fig. 2).
Kaplan–Meier curves shows the difference of survival rate between patients taking digoxin (blue) and digoxin-amiodarone combination (green) treatment (1A). The difference of sudden cardiac death rate between patients taking digoxin (blue) and digoxin-amiodarone combination (green) was also demonstrated (1B).
The combination group were divided into 3 subgroups based on duration of combination to see the effect of dose accumulation (Table 4). Regarding all-cause mortality, the HR significantly increased regardless of duration of combination, which were 1.771 (95% CI = 1.511–2.076, P < 0.001) for less than 14 days, 1.747 (95% CI = 1.510–2.023, P < 0.001) for between 14 to 60 days, and 1.735 (95% CI = 1.473–2.044, P < 0.001) for more than 60 days. For SCD, the HR was not increased regardless the duration subjects receiving the combination. The HR were 0.845 (95% CI = 0.551–1.295, P = 0.439) for less than 14 days, 1.266 (95% CI = 0.905–1.771, P = 0.168) for between 14 to 60 days, and 0.805 (95% CI = 0.516–1.257, P = 0.340) for more than 60 days.
According to our study, digoxin-amiodarone combination is associated with excess all-cause mortality compared to digoxin alone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the real-world effect of digoxin-amiodarone rather than focusing on pharmacokinetics or few cases’ outcomes. The characteristics of the two study groups differed regarding risk factors of atherosclerosis and cardiac comorbidities. This reflected the real-world situation that patients with more comorbidities would receive amiodarone more often, and the more comorbidities a patient have, the higher chance drug-drug interaction occurs.
In our study, all-cause mortality increased regardless of duration of combination, including patients who received combination for less than 14 days. Prior case report showed that SDC started to fluctuate and elevate soon after amiodarone administration15, suggesting that the potential harm may begin early when patient started to receive digoxin-amiodarone combination.
Digoxin was recommended for treatment of HF and AF since its discovery two hundred years ago16. It slows AF rate by several proposed mechanisms17, and benefits patients with LV dysfunction, heart failure, or hemodynamic instability8,18. Patients with above condition often also received other medication therapy, and drug-drug interaction is an important issue for these patients since the therapeutic range of digoxin is narrow. Certain groups of patients require digoxin and amiodarone, for example, those with AF, acute coronary syndrome, or LV systolic dysfunction, digoxin and amiodarone are important choices of medication in this scenario. While using this combination, serum digoxin level would increase, and this may potentially lead to undesired outcome.
Plenty of medication were known to interact with digoxin. For example, bench and mice study had showed that adding quinidine would inhibited P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin transport, and increased plasma digoxin concentration19. In cohort studies, addition of quinidine resulted in a mean 2.5-fold increase in SDC (from 0.98 ± 0.37 to 2.47 ± 0.71 ng/ml), P < 0.001) and the rate of digoxin toxicity20. Suggestion of a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the digoxin dose when quinidine were used has been proposed21.
In the PALLAS trial, up to 33.6 (vs.32.5%) of patients in the trial were under digoxin therapy at baseline9. Because of potential of increased digoxin level caused by digoxin-dronedarone interaction, the investigators had been advised to use digoxin with caution and monitor serum levels closely. However, digoxin serum concentrations were still significantly higher in patients assigned to dronedarone therapy. This implied that despite judicious monitor and adjustment of digoxin use, adverse events of combination seemed not completely preventable. Among 1,070 patients receiving digoxin at baseline, there was a significant increase in CV deaths after add-on dronedarone (HR: 7.24, 95% CI: 1.65–31.67, P = 0.009). In contrast, among 2,166 patients not receiving digoxin at baseline, there was no significant increase in CV death with add-on dronedarone (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.26–2.19; P = 0.61). Possible harmful effects of digoxin-dronedarone combination need be clarified in further study.
Few case reports also addressed the elevation of SDC and potentially fatal cardiac toxicity of digoxin when digoxin and dronedarone were used concomitantly, and the toxicity could occurred soon after starting digoxin22.
Similar effects could be observed in digoxin-amiodarone combination. Animal and cohort study both showed that amiodarone could increase serum digoxin level, digoxin bioavailability, and showed a trend to prolong digoxin elimination half-life and decreased its renal clearance23,24,25,26. Case report in from pediatrics also demonstrated digoxin toxicity after initiation of amiodarone27. This had led to dose change or cessation of digoxin in substantial percentage of patients28. However, large scale long-term clinical outcome of digoxin-amiodarone combination was lacking.
In the analysis of cause of death, the combination group had more death other vascular disease before PS match. This is probably due to the fact that the combination group had more CAD, VHD, CKD, and more have received coronary revascularization. After PS match, the rate of death due to non-arrhythmic cardiac disease and other vascular disease were still higher in the combination group, suggesting that the combination may be associated with vascular events. Prior studies had pointed out increase thromboembolism associated with digoxin, possibly due to higher endothelium and platelet activation in patients receiving digoxin29,30. These findings are in accord with the results from post-hoc analysis of SPORTIF III and V and ROCKET AF2,31, which showed that digoxin is associated with increased myocardial infarction and vascular-related death1. Further investigation is needed to get more insight into the relationship between digoxin-amiodarone combination and endothelium and platelet activation.
There were several limitations in the study. First, selection bias remains despite PS match since it is impossible to include all the variables that may determine group membership from claimed database32. Higher rate of death due to respiratory disease and infectious disease might suggest that the combination group still represent a frailer group of patients despite PS match. Second, several important data were missing from claimed database, such as the SDC of each patient, renal function, left ventricle systolic function, drug compliance, and adequacy of anticoagulation. Prior investigators had added some of these determinants into regression model, and adjustment for these determinants, such as left ventricular function and serum creatinine level, did not change the finding that digoxin is associated with increased mortality. Third, the results may be affected by miss-coding. Because a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled outcome studies examining the effect of digoxin-amiodarone combination therapy are not available, real world situation could only be reflected by registration study. If the combination is proved harmful, the number need to harm will be 15, and up to 0.4% of all patients could be effected28.
