A New Network Feature Affects the Intervention Performance on Public Opinion Dynamic Networks
The neighborhood network structure plays an important role in the collective opinion of an opinion dynamic system. Does it also affect the intervention performance? To answer this question, we apply three intervention methods on an opinion dynamic model, the weighted DeGroot model, to change the convergent opinion value \(\bar{x}\). And we define a new network feature Ω, called ‘network differential degree’, to measure how node degrees couple with influential values in the network, i.e., large Ω indicates nodes with high degree is more likely to couple with large influential value. We investigate the relationship between the intervention performance and the network differential degree Ω in the following three intervention cases: (1) add one special agent (shill) to connect to one normal agent; (2) add one edge between two normal agents; (3) add a number of edges among agents. Through simulations we find significant correlation between the intervention performance, i.e., \(|\Delta {\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) (the maximum value of the change of convergent opinion value \(|\Delta \bar{x}|\)) and Ω in all three cases: the intervention performance \(|\Delta {\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) is higher when Ω is smaller. So Ω could be used to predict how difficult it is to intervene and change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model. Meanwhile, a theorem of adding one edge and an algorithm for adding optimal edges are given.
In recent years, the study of collective behaviors of multi-agent systems is a hot topic. In multi-agent systems, each agent interacts with its neighbors. But at the macroscopic level, the system will spontaneous form new phenomenon which can not be found in a single agent, e.g., opinion consensus1, crowd panic2, flocking of birds3,4, schooling of fishes3, synchronization5,6, swarm intelligence7, pattern formation8,9.
When the self-organized collective behavior is not what people expected, researchers proposed several intervention methods to intervene multi-agent systems10,11. Soft control12,13 is a novel non-destructive method which does not change the update rule of already-existing agents, but adds several special agents, called shills, into the system. Shills have their intervention purpose and they can be redesigned and controlled by us. However, normal agents do not distinguish shills from normal ones, i.e., normal agents regard shills as normal ones. Therefore, shills can only affect their neighboring agents with the similar strength as normal ones. The soft control intervention method has successfully changed the convergent opinion value of opinion dynamic system14,15,16,17, promoted cooperation of multi-person prisoner’s dilemma game models18,19 and guided consensus of the Vicsek model12,13,20,21,22.
In many multi-agent systems, agents interact with others following local rules, i.e., each agent only interacts with its neighbors. Neighbors are usually defined in two ways: one is based on a given neighborhood network, i.e., the neighborhood network is static with time, such as the DeGroot model1; the other one is based on a dynamic neighborhood network, i.e., the neighborhood network evolves with time according to positions of agents, such as the Vicsek model23. Obviously, the structure of the neighborhood graph affects the collective behaviors of multi-agent systems.
As we know, the neighborhood network has impact on the dynamic of the opinion dynamics systems. Yu-Song et al.24 found that it is easier to reach consensus in the Sznajd model if the clustering coefficient of small-world and scale-free networks is larger. Fortunato et al.25 found that the consensus threshold of the HK model is closely related to the average degree of the neighborhood network. Amblard et al.26 found that when the connectivity level of the small-world network is beyond a critical value, the whole population drifts to one extreme opinion. Based on an Ising-like system, Kuperman et al.27 found that with the change of the underlying small-world network, both the amplitude threshold for the detection of the external modulation and the width of the stochastic-resonance peak show considerable variation. Castellano et al.28 found that the voter model on small-world networks does not display the emergence of complete order in the thermodynamic limit which can be found in the regular topologies.
And the neighborhood network might also affect the intervention performance. In this paper, we focus on the question of “whether and how the network feature affects the performance of intervention”. We study this question based on the weighted DeGroot model14,15. Among opinion dynamics models1,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36, the DeGroot model1 is the basic and classic one. It has been widely studied over several decades37. The update rule of the DeGroot model is relatively simple which leads this model to be understood mathematically with strict theoretical results. With such simple update rule, the DeGroot model can still capture basic aspects of social learning38,39. And it is a powerful tool for studying various issues of information and learning40. When the update matrix is an aperiodic, irreducible and stochastic matrix, the DeGroot model defined system can reach consensus1. The soft control method has been successfully used to change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model14,15. In this paper, three intervention methods are used to change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model. (i) Using the soft control method by adding one shill connected with one normal agent. (ii) Adding one edge between two unconnected agents. A theorem is proposed to help decide add which edge can increase (or decrease) the convergent opinion value. (iii) Adding several edges. We propose an algorithm for adding edges which can be proved to maximize the change of convergent opinion value. And then, as the main part of this paper, we study how does the network feature affect the intervention performance. We use \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) to measure the intervention performance, where \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) is the maximum value of the difference between the new convergent value \(\bar{x}^{\prime} \) and the original convergent opinion value \(\bar{x}\) by each intervention methods. Larger \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) means the system is easier to be intervened.
Is there a network feature correlated with the intervention performance \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)? We find that most of the known network features (including average degree, maximum degree, minimum degree, average path length, diameter, degree centrality and clustering coefficient) do not have significant correlation with \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). In our weighted Degroot model, each node has an influential value to indicate its influence weights, which is based on the fact that the influence of one node is an intrinsic characteristic14,15,41 and it is not entirely determined by its degree41,42,43. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new network feature Ω, called ‘network differential degree’, to measure how node degrees couple with influential values in the network. Large Ω indicates the node with high degree is more likely to couple with large influential value. Through simulations for all three intervention methods we find significant correlation between \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) and Ω: smaller Ω leads to larger \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) is. This means the weighted DeGroot model (system) can be intervened easier if Ω of the network is smaller. So Ω reflects how difficult it is to intervene and change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model.
In this section, simulations are done to study the relationship between network features and \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) in three intervention cases both on computer-generated networks and empirical networks.
The simulations run on instances based on three types of networks: 3000 random networks, 3000 scale-free networks and 3000 small-world networks. Each network has 100 nodes. Random networks are created by using the Erdös–Rényi method48: each network is initialised as a 100 isolated nodes and then edges are added with probability 0.3 between each pair of nodes. The scale-free networks are created by using the Barabási–Albert method49: each network is initialised as a complete graph of five nodes and then each new node is connected to five existing nodes with a probability which is proportional to already-existing node’s degree until all 100 nodes are added. The small-world networks are created by using the Watts–Strogatz method50: each network is initialised as a 20-nearest-neighbor coupled network and then each edge is rewired with probability 0.3. The initial opinion of all agents are random values which follow an independent uniformed distribution over [0,100]. The influential values of all agents of each network are random values which follow an independent uniformed distribution over [1,100]. In the case of adding one shill, we let xs(0) = 100 and us = 100. Shill as is connected to the agent who can maximize the increase of the convergent opinion value. In the case of adding one edge, the edge is added between two unconnected nodes which can maximize the increase of the convergent opinion value. In the case of adding a number of edges, we use Algorithm 1 to find edges which can maximize the increase of the convergent opinion value. Results for increasing and decreasing the convergent opinion of the system are symmetrical with the above settings, so we only show results for the case of increasing the convergent opinion in the following.
Based on three type networks (random networks, scale-free networks and small-world networks), Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the known network features and the intervention performance \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) by adding one shill. The data is evenly divided into several intervals according to the value of the corresponding known network feature. And a box-plot is plotted to represent the distribution of \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). We can see that there is no significant correlation between known network features and the intervention performance \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). This means that the known network features can not be used to predict whether the system can be intervened easily.
The correlation between known popular global network features and intervention performance (\(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)) in the case of adding one shill to increase convergent opinion value. In each figure, the x-axis is the corresponding known network feature and the y-axis is the intervention performance \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\).
Figure 2 shows simulation results of the correlation between the network differential degree (Ω) and the intervention performance (\(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)) by adding one shill for each instance. The data is evenly divided into several intervals according to the value of Ω. In each interval, a box-plot is plotted to represent the distribution of \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). Patterns which are found in random network and the scale-free network instances (Fig. 2a and b) both show that it is easier to change the convergent opinion value by adding one shill when Ω is small. This pattern is significant which can not be seen in Fig. 1 for these known network features.
The correlation between the network differential degree (Ω) and the intervention performance (\(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)) by adding one shill to increase the convergent opinion value. (a) is for random networks; (b) is for scale-free networks; (c) is for small-world networks; (d) is for networks of three types in one scale.
Similarly, we show box-plot patterns for the case of adding one edge and the case of adding several edges respectively in Figs 3 and 4. Patterns for random networks and scale-free networks show that larger Ω leads to smaller \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). That means the system is easier to be intervened when Ω is small by adding one or several edges.
The correlation between the network differential degree (Ω) and the intervention performance (\(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)) in the case of adding one edge to increase the convergent opinion value. (a) is for random networks; (b) is for scale-free networks; (c) is for small-world networks; (d) is for networks of three types in one scale.
The correlation between the network differential degree (Ω) and the intervention performance (\(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\)) in the case of adding several edges to increase the convergent opinion value. (a) is for random networks; (b) is for scale-free networks; (c) is for small-world networks; (d) is for networks of three types in one scale.
Results for the small-world networks (Figs 2(c), 3(c) and 4(c)) have the similar pattern in general although they do not look as significant as the random networks and scale-free networks. This is because the range of Ω of the small-world networks is much smaller than that of the random networks and scale-free networks which can be seen in Figs 2(d), 3(d) and 4(d).
We also investigate the network differential degree of seven empirical networks: (1) Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network51 (which is abbreviate to BOTN in the following) is a who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin OTC. It has 6005 nodes and 35592 edges. Members of Bitcoin OTC rate other members in a scale of −10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. (2) Bitcoin Alpha web of trust network51 (which is abbreviate to BATN in the following). It is similar to BOTN, but graded from Bitcoin Alpha instead of Bitcoin OTC. And it has 7604 nodes and 24186 edges. (3) Wikipedia adminship election data52,53 (which is abbreviate to WPAS in the following) has nearly 2,800 elections with around 100,000 total votes and about 7,000 users participating in the elections (either casting a vote or being voted on). It has 8297 nodes and 110087 edges. In this network, each edge eij has a weight (1 for support, 0 for neutral, −1 for oppose), which means the attitude of agent ai to agent aj. (4) The collaboration network of scientists posting preprints on the condensed matter54,55,56 (which is abbreviate to SPPC in the following) has 16725 nodes and 47594 edges. This network is weighted, with weights assigned as described in the original papers. (5) The collaboration network of scientists posting preprints on the high-energy theory54,55,56 (which is abbreviate to SPPH in the following) has 8361 nodes and 15751 edges. The network is weighted, with weights assigned as described in the original papers. (6) A coauthorship network of scientists working on network theory and experiment57 (which is abbreviate to SPPN in the following) has 1586 nodes and 2742 edges. The network is weighted, with weights assigned as described in the original papers. (7) The weighted network of coappearances of characters in Victor Hugo’s novel “Les Miserables”58 (which is abbreviate to CCLM in the following) has 77 nodes and 254 edges. Nodes represent characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of characters that appear in the same chapter of the book. The values on the edges are the number of such coappearances.
Before our method is applied, these seven networks are converted to node-weighted undirected graphs by the following four steps: (1) for each network (N, E), the influence value of each node ai is obtained by \({u}_{i}=\sum _{j}{w}_{ji}\); (2) all edges are simply converted to undirected links; (3) each node is added a self-loop edge; (4) the maximal connected subgraph of the network is extracted, because our method is only applied to connected graph. Now we get seven new networks denoted as BOTN*, BATN*, WPAS*, SPPC*, SPPH*, SPPN* and CCLM* from the original networks of BOTN, BATN, WPAS, SPPC, SPPH, SPPN and CCLM.
The network differential degree and the size of these seven networks are given in Table 2. The network differential degree Ω of WPAS* (which relates to Wikipedia adminship) is the largest, which means this network might be relatively harder to intervene. Ω of BOTN* (which relates to Bitcoin OTC trust network) is the smallest which means this network might be relatively easier to intervene. Furthermore, we can see that the network differential degrees of networks of the same type (two Bitcoin networks, i.e., BOTN* and BATN*, and three collaboration networks, i.e., SPPC*, SPPH* and SPPN*) are similar. This is because the underneath mechanism to construct the network actually plays an important role on the difficulty of being intervened.
This paper focuses on a new question of the relationship between the network feature and the intervention performance. We study this question based on the weighted DeGroot model. To measure how node degrees couple with influential values in the network, we propose a new network feature Ω, named network differential degree. Large Ω indicates node with large degree is more likely to couple with large influential value.
We study how Ω affects the performance of intervention by three intervention methods: (1) adding one special agent (shill) to connect to one normal agent; (2) adding one edge between two normal agents; (3) adding a number of edges among agents.
The intervention purpose is to change the convergent opinion value \(\bar{x}\) of the system. We use \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) to measure the intervention performance, where \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) is the maximum value of the difference between the new convergent value \(\bar{x}^{\prime} \) and the original convergent opinion value \(\bar{x}\) by each intervention methods. Larger \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) means better intervention performance. Through simulations on random networks, scale-free networks and small-world networks, we find significant correlation between \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\) and Ω: smaller Ω leads to larger \(|{\rm{\Delta }}{\bar{x}}^{\ast }|\). That means the system is easier to be intervened when Ω is small. In addition, we propose and proof a theorem about adding which edge can increase or decrease the convergent opinion value in the case of adding one edge intervention method. And we propose and proof an algorithm which can maximum the change of convergent opinion value in the case of adding several edges.
In conclusion, the new proposed network feature, network differential degree Ω, has significant correlation with the intervention performance: we can get better intervention performance when Ω is smaller. Our approach suggests a way to predict with which kind of network the opinion dynamics system would be easily intervened. The results may shed lights on the intervention of other multi-agent systems.
