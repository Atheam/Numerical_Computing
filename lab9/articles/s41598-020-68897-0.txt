Acute hyperglycaemia is not associated with the development of atrial fibrillation in healthy pigs
Development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) is driven by comorbidities such as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In animal models of chronic hyperglycaemia, progression of AF has been proposed to be triggered by oxidative stress, apoptosis and fibrosis. Acute glycosylation of CaMKII has been associated with increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in acute hyperglycaemia. However, the proarrhythmogenic effect of acute hyperglycaemia has not been investigated. Nine healthy, anesthetized pigs (54 ± 6 kg) were instrumented with electrophysiologic catheters and a multielectrode array on the epicardium of the left atrial anterior wall. Left and right atrial effective refractory periods (AERP), inducibility of AF and left atrial epicardial conduction velocities (CV) were measured at baseline (BL), increasing steps of blood glucose (200–500 mg/dL in steps of 100 mg/dL by glucose infusion) and repeated after normalisation of blood glucose levels (recovery). Serum electrolytes were kept constant during measurements by means of sodium and potassium infusion. There were no significant differences in AERP, CV or AF inducibility between BL and recovery. Heart rate remained constant regardless of blood glucose levels (BL: 103 ± 18 bpm, 500 mg/dL: 103 ± 18 bpm, r = 0.02, p = 0.346). Mean left as well as right AERP increased with higher glucose levels. CV increased with glucose levels (1.25 (1.04, 1.67) m/s at BL vs. 1.53 (1.22, 2.15) m/s at 500 mg/dL, r = 0.85, p = 0.034). Rate of AF inducibility in the left atrium remained constant throughout the whole protocol (AF episodes > 10 s: mean inducibility of 80% at BL vs. 69% at 500 mg/dL, p = 0.32, episodes > 30 s: 0% at BL vs. 0% at 500 mg/dL, p = 0.17). Our data imply that acute hyperglycaemia is associated with lower arrhythmogenic substrate and does not promote AF inducibility.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in humans and is associated with an increased risk of stroke, morbidity and death. Progression of the disease is associated with risk factors such as structural heart disease, valvular heart disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity1,2,3. Extensive research is conducted on how exactly these conditions favour the development and progression of AF, but the exact mechanisms remain unknown4.



In early stages of AF, triggers like ectopic beats from the pulmonary veins, atrial premature beats or episodes of atrial tachycardia initiate the arrhythmia. Recurrent episodes of AF lead to electrical remodelling of the atria, including shortening of atrial effective refractory periods action potential duration and a loss of rate adaption which favour arrhythmia stability (“AF begets AF”)4,5. During the development to persistent AF, the substrate (i.e. changes in atrial architecture, alteration of extracellular matrix composition, dissociation of endo- and epicardium) gains in importance over the initiating triggers4,6.
Fifteen percent of patients with AF suffer from DM7. Patients with impaired fasting glucose or DM have an elevated risk (33% per mmol/L increased fasting glucose) of developing AF8,9.
Prior animal studies have suggested that oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation favour AF progression in the presence of DM10. Glycosylation of CaMK II (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) has been proposed as a possible proarrhythmic mechanism in DM or hyperglycaemia11. Glycosylation of CaMK II favours afterdepolarisations, one of the key mechanisms in AF development4. This mechanism has been demonstrated in explanted human ventricular myocardium, in diabetic rats and in cell cultures11.
However, it is not known, if acute hyperglycaemia affects the atrial electrical substrate and increases AF inducibility. In the present study, we investigated, whether the effect of acute hyperglycaemia on the electrical substrate is a possible determinant for AF inducibility and stability.
All nine animals were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences between measurements during BL and recovery, so results from recovery phase will not be reported here. Mean glucose level at BL was 92 ± 18 mg/dL.
Heart rate remained constant regardless of blood glucose levels (BL: 103 ± 18 bpm, 200 mg/dL: 98 ± 17 bpm, 300 mg/dL: 98 ± 16 bpm, 400 mg/dL: 99 ± 14 bpm, 500 mg/dL: 103 ± 18 bpm, r = 0.02, p = 0.346).
Mean left (r = 0.97, p = 0.003, Fig. 1A) as well as right AERP (r = 0.97, p = 0.003, Fig. 1B) increased with higher glucose levels. In stepwise comparison, left AERP at 400 and 500 mg/dL was higher compared to baseline (Fig. 1A, p = 0.005), while there was a similar trend in right AERP (p = 0.08). AF inducibility was not increased during hyperglycaemia. In the left atrium, AF episodes longer than 10 s were inducible in 80% at BL, 62% at 200 mg/dL, 84% at 300 mg/dL, 73% at 400 mg/dL, 69% at 500 mg/dL (p = 0.32, Fig. 2A). AF episodes longer than 30 s were inducible only at two drive trains in one animal at 200 mg/dL (p = 0.17, Fig. 2B). In the right atrium, AF episodes longer than 10 s were inducible in 78% at BL, 49% at 200 mg/dL, 49% at 300 mg/dL, 56% at 400 mg/dL, 47% at 500 mg/dL (p = 0.016, Fig. 2D). Compared to BL, short AF episodes were significantly less induced at 200 (p = 0.038), 300 (p = 0.038) and 500 mg% (p = 0.022). AF episodes longer than 30 s were inducible only at one drive train in one animal at BL (p = 0.94, Fig. 2E). Median AF duration did not differ between all glucose steps in the left (p = 0.23, Fig. 2C) and right (p = 0.12, Fig. 2F) atrium.

Mean CV increased with glucose levels (1.25 (1.04, 1.67) m/s at BL, 1.39 (1.17, 1.94) m/s at 200 mg%, 1.37 (1.12, 2.01) m/s at 300 mg%, 1.73 (1.24, 2.17) m/s at 400 mg% and 1.53 (1.22, 2.15) m/s at 500 mg%, r = 0.85, p = 0.034, Fig. 3). Mean CV at 400 mg% was higher compared to BL (p = 0.002).

Although electrolytes were substituted and kept within a normal range, exact balance throughout the protocol was not achieved (Table 1). Serum potassium (BL: 3.5 ± 0.15 mmol/L, 500 mg%: 3.84 ± 0.43; r = 0.92, p = 0.005) was over substituted, while sodium decreased with increasing glucose (BL: 140 (139.5, 141.5) mmol/L, 500 mg%: 132 (129, 136.5) mmol/L, r = 0.99, p < 0.001). Serum calcium and chloride levels remained unchanged. pH decreased with increasing glucose levels.
Patients with DM are more likely to develop AF and DM favours the progression of AF7,8,9,10,18. Animal studies have suggested that chronic factors e.g. oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation play and favour AF progression in the presence of DM10. However, it is not known, if hyperglycaemia per se represents an acute arrhythmogenic substrate or if AF develops secondarily to structural atrial changes. Here, we could demonstrate that susceptibility for AF does not change due to acute hyperglycaemia. Interestingly, acute hyperglycaemia was more associated with a strong increase in pathlength and shorter AF episodes.
We could demonstrate in our study, that hyperglycemia leads to prolongation of CV, ERP resulting in shorter AF durations.
The only in vivo study on the role of glucose levels on atrial electrophysiology was performed in open chest dogs19. Inducibility of AF was higher in hypoglycaemia than in normo- and hyperglycaemia, while refractory periods tended to increase with the glucose levels. This could be explained by the fact that animals were in hypokalaemia during hypoglycaemia. Notably, glucose levels showed a large variability and tests were performed at only one level of hyperglycaemia at a median glucose level of 280 mg%.
Erickson et al. demonstrated that hyperglycaemia leads to glycosylation of CaMKII11. Acute glucose elevation activates CaMKII which leads to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release events that can contribute to development of arrhythmias. This could be demonstrated in intact hearts and diabetic rats, where glucose-induced premature ventricular complexes and ventricular tachycardias could be suppressed by blockade of CaMKII or glycosylation of CaMKII. It remains unclear, if this mechanism might also play a role in pathogenesis of AF in patients with DM. Since AF inducibility was not increased in this large animal study when electrolytes were kept within a normal range, longer durations of hyperglycaemia might be necessary for this mechanism to become relevant.
Shortening of atrial refractory periods is attributed to an increased stability of AF, which is described as electrical remodelling during the progression of atrial fibrillation5,20. Henceforward, therapeutic agents prolonging APD and refractory periods are used for cardioversion of patients4. In the setting of hyperglycaemia, prolonged refractory periods seem to protect the atria from sustaining AF induced by burst pacing. Our findings that hyperglycaemia prolongs refractory periods are in line with prior in vivo and in vitro studies19,21.
In other animal studies, increased AF stability was often associated with a reduction in conduction velocity15,22,23,24. In our study, conduction velocities were increased by hyperglycaemia, which may also contribute to the unchanged AF inducibility throughout the protocol. It may also explain the fact that with the right atrium, short AF episodes were even less frequent with increasing glucose levels.
Clinical studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance and DM are associated with an increased risk of developing AF in all-comers8,9,18, patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery25 and after myocardial infarction26. In patients undergoing AF ablation, impaired glucose tolerance and DM are associated with structural remodelling (i.e. longer total atrial conduction times, lower bipolar voltages)18. These findings suggest that DM promotes AF through structural alterations.
The role of DM in structural atrial remodelling has been studied in multiple animal models. In mice with stroptozoticin-induced hyperglycaemia, it has been suggested that mast cells contribute to the pathogenesis of DM-induced AF via enhancement of inflammation and fibrosis27. Genetic type II diabetic rats showed increased atrial arrhythmogenicity, intra-atrial conduction disturbances attributed to interstitial fibrosis, while refractory periods were comparable to wild-type rats28. In Langendorff-perfused hearts of rabbits with alloxan-induced DM, AF inducibility was increased while refractory periods and action potential durations were prolonged. These changes were also attributed to structural alterations (i.e. increase in collagen volume fraction)21. In Langendorff-perfused hearts of rats with streptozoticin-induced DM, AF inducibility and heterogeneity of refractory periods were increased under sympathetic nerve stimulation, suggesting that neural remodelling might also play a role the pathogenesis of AF in the presence of DM29.
Our findings suggest that rather systemic and structural changes during DM than acute hyperglycaemia play an important role in AF pathogenesis. This is in line with prior animal studies that require longer exposure to a diabetic state in order to manifest increased susceptibility to AF.
