CMR-derived ECVs vary with myocardial region
         and associate with the regional wall thickness
This study was designed to identify whether the position and size of the
            region of interest (ROI) influence extracellular volume fraction (ECV) measurements.
            Patients with localized (n = 203) or infiltrative (n = 215) cardiomyopathies and 36
            normal controls were enrolled in this study. ECV measurements at 4 different regions,
            including the anterior, septal, posterior and lateral wall regions, were measured, and
            all groups were compared. Regional ECV was correlated with the corresponding regional
            wall thickness. The diagnostic power to differentiate the myocardial abnormalities was
            evaluated for each myocardial region. ECVs measured using five different ROI sizes
            within each myocardial region were compared. Our results showed that ECVs varied among
            the myocardial regions, and this variation was significantly associated with regional
            wall thicknesses. For the detection of myocardial abnormalities, regional ECV revealed
            similar results as ECV derived from the whole region except for the anterior region. No
            significant difference was found in the ECVs measured using the five different ROI
            sizes. In conclusion, CMR-derived ECVs vary with myocardial region, and this variation
            is significantly associated with the regional wall thickness. In contrast, the measured
            size of the ROI has less of an effect on the ECV.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been widely used to quantify
            myocardial interstitial matrix by calculating the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) of
            the myocardium1,2,3,4.
            Quantitative analysis of myocardial ECV can be performed by measuring T1
            in blood and myocardium before and after administration of contrast medium. T1
            measurement is most often performed by drawing a region of interest (ROI) in the central
            area of the left ventricle (LV) cavity and the septal myocardium on pixel-wise T1 mapping
            5,6,7,8,9.
            The position of ROIs is determined first, and the average T1 values
            within the ROIs are then computed. For the assessment of diffuse myocardial abnormality,
            the position of the ROI can be drawn within the myocardium, except for the regions with
            enhancement shown on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. This method assumes that
            the diffuse myocardial abnormality is distributed homogeneously (uniform ECV) within the
            noninfarcted regions. However, the spatial variation of diffuse myocardial abnormality
            is diverse and depends on the various cardiomyopathies
            10,11.
            Therefore, the ECV measurement could be affected by the position of the
            ROI if significant regional variation in the interstitial matrix exists. Furthermore,
            the size of the ROI is arbitrarily drawn, and whether it is a confounder in the
            quantification of the ECV is unknown. To measure subtle changes in the ECV expected for
            diffuse myocardial abnormality, it is essential to circumvent factors that confound the
            ECV measurement using the ROI-based method.
In this study, we evaluated the ECV from different myocardial regions and
            compared them in both the patient and control groups. ECV values measured from different
            sizes of ROI within the same region were also compared. Our goal was to identify whether
            the regional position and the measured size of ROIs affect the quantification of the
            ECV.
The demographics of the study population are summarized in Table
                  1. Compared with the control group, the
               patient groups were older and included more males; however, body surface areas were
               similar. There were significant differences in LV function and mass at end-diastole
               between the patient and control groups. In the patient group, ten different types of
               cardiomyopathies were included for further analysis. The homogeneous disease (H.D.)
               group (n = 215) included cardiac amyloidosis (n = 15), arrhythmogenic right
               ventricular cardiomyopathy (n = 47), Brugada syndrome (n = 64), dilated
               cardiomyopathy (n = 37), Fabry disease (n = 24) and heart failure with preserved
               ejection fraction (n = 28). The regional disease (R.D.) group (n = 203) included
               hypertensive cardiac disease (n = 81), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 87), ischemic
               cardiomyopathy (n = 21) and myocarditis (n = 14).
For the group comparison, the R.D. group had a significantly higher
                  ECVwhole compared to that in H.D. group (28.3 ± 6.7% vs.
               26.3 ± 4.0%, p < 0.001) and in the control group (28.3 ± 6.7% vs. 22.6 ± 1.6%,
               p < 0.001). The H.D. group also had significantly higher
                  ECVwhole compared with those of the control group
               (26.3 ± 4.0% vs. 22.6 ± 1.6%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1a). The regional ECV (ECVreg) measurements
               from the four different regions in each group are listed in Table 2. For regional comparisons, the septal region had the
               highest ECV compared with the other three regions in all the groups. In the R.D.
               group, four significant ECVreg differences were found. These
               were between the septal and anterior regions (29.4 ± 6.89% vs. 27.1 ± 5.93%,
               p < 0.001), the septal and lateral regions (29.4 ± 6.89% vs. 27.4 ± 6.48,
               p < 0.001), the posterior and later regions (29.1 ± 7.27% vs. 27.4 ± 6.48%,
               p < 0.001), and the posterior and anterior regions (29.1 ± 7.27% vs. 27.1 ± 5.93%,
               p < 0.001) (Fig. 2a). Similar
                  ECVreg differences were found in the H.D. group. These were
               between the septal and anterior regions (27.1 ± 3.88% vs. 25.2 ± 3.76%,
               p < 0.001), the septal and lateral regions (27.1 ± 3.88% vs. 25.7 ± 3.89%,
               p < 0.001), the posterior and later regions (27.2 ± 4.26% vs. 25.7 ± 3.89%,
               p < 0.001), and the posterior and anterior regions (27.2 ± 4.26% vs. 25.2 ± 3.76%,
               p < 0.001) (Fig. 2b). In the control
               group, two significant regional differences in the ECVreg were
               found: between the septal and anterior regions (25.3 ± 3.01% vs. 23.5 ± 2.80%,
               p = 0.012) and the septal and lateral regions (25.3 ± 3.01% vs. 24.1 ± 2.55%,
               p = 0.032) (Fig. 2c). These interregional
               variation patterns were consistent with the native T1 in all groups
                  (Fig. 2d–f). In contrast, no significant
               interregional variation was found in postcontrast T1 in each group.

                           means and 95% confidential intervals.
Strong agreements between ECVwhole and
                  ECVreg were seen when measured from the anterior
               (ICC = 0.932, p < 0.001), septal (ICC = 0.948, p < 0.001), posterior
               (ICC = 0.938, p < 0.001) and lateral regions (ICC = 0.939, p < 0.001).
               Bland–Altman plots showing the mean difference between these two ECVs are shown in
                  Fig. 3. The diagnostic power for detecting
               the myocardial abnormalities was similar between ECVwhole
               (AUC = 0.872, 95% CI [0.828, 0.917], p < 0.001) and ECVreg
               for the septal (AUC = 0.847, 95% CI [0.795, 0.899], p < 0.001), posterior
               (AUC = 0.870, 95% CI [0.829, 0.910], p < 0.001), and lateral regions (AUC = 0.846,
               95% CI [0.799, 0.892], p < 0.001) (Fig. 4). The ECVreg measured in the anterior region
               showed significantly lower diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.786, 95% CI [0.718,
               0.853], p < 0.001) than in the other regions (compared with septal, p = 0.0164;
               posterior, p = 0.0049; and lateral, p = 0.0166). The cut-off values for each
               myocardial region are listed in Table 3. The
               standard deviation among these cut-off values was 0.82%.

                           (upper left), septal (upper right), posterior (lower left) and lateral
                           regions (lower right). The solid red horizontal line plots the mean

                           (differences from the mean of 1.96 SDs) for each region.

The inter-ECV within four different
               regions was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group
               (compared with R.D. group: 2.13 ± 1.16% vs. 1.29 ± 0.52%, p < 0.001; compared with
               H.D. group: 1.82 ± 0.93% vs. 1.29 ± 0.52%, p < 0.001). In addition, the
                  inter-ECV measured in the R.D. group was
               significantly higher than that measured in the H.D. group (2.13 ± 1.16% vs.
               1.82 ± 0.93%, p = 0.016) (Fig. 1b). A
               relatively broad range of inter-ECV was found in
               the R.D. group compared with the H.D. (range 0.26–6.68% vs. 0.09–5.54%) and control
               groups (range 0.26–6.68% vs. range 0.38–2.77%). In addition, Fig. 5 showed that the ECVreg was
               significantly correlated with the corresponding regional wall thickness in the
               patient cohort, except for patients with Fabry disease and myocarditis (Table
                  4). This significant correlation was also
               found in the control groups (r = 0.183; p = 0.028) (Fig. 6).

                           group.
Table 5 compares the ECV results
               derived from ROIs of different sizes in the patient and control groups. No
               significant difference was found in the ECV measured from different sized ROIs for
               each myocardial region in either the patient or control group.
For the intra-observer variability, the ECV of repeated measurements
               range from 19.3% to 49.4% with medium 24.8%. The bias was 0% with 1.048% standard
               deviation of the absolute difference (Fig. 7a). For the inter-observer variability, the ECV of repeated
               measurements range from 19.3% to 49.4% with medium 24.5%. The bias was -0.131% with
               1.184% standard deviation of the absolute difference (Fig. 7b).

                           regional ECV measurements from 120 myocardial regions in 30 subjects
                           randomly selected from each group.
In this study, we demonstrated that CMR-derived ECVs varied with the
            myocardial region and that this variation was significantly increased in patients with
            ventricular hypertrophy. Our results also showed that the diagnostic power of regional
            ECVs was similar to that of ECVs derived from the whole region except for the anterior
            region. These findings suggest that ECV measurement using the ROI-based method is
            feasible to detect myocardial abnormalities compared with the measurement from the whole
            region. However, regional ECV may lead to clinically significant errors if ECV was
            assessed and compared in different myocardial regions. In contrast, no significant
            difference was found in the ECVs from the 5 different ROI sizes. This finding suggests
            that the size of the ROI has less of an effect on the ECV measurement based on the
            ROI-based method.
CMR-derived ECV is a useful biomarker to quantify diffuse interstitial matrix
            2,5,8,12
            and predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes
            13,14,15.
            ECV is most often measured using an ROI-based method, which assumes that
            the myocardial abnormality is homogeneously distributed (uniform ECV) within the
            noninfarcted myocardial regions. Kawel et al.16
            used CMR to evaluate acquisition factors that may result in the variation
            of measured ECV, including magnetic field strength, cardiac phase and myocardial region
            in normal controls. They found that ECV did not vary significantly with field strength
            but did vary with cardiac phase and myocardial region. They concluded that ECV was
            significantly higher for the septum compared to the nonseptal myocardium in normal
            controls. Recently, Vita et al. demonstrated that ECV varies according to the myocardial
            region in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
            17.
            In this study, we further demonstrated that this interregional variation
            of ECV was more significant in the patient group than the control group and was
            positively associated with the corresponding regional wall thickness. These findings
            suggest that the degree of regional variation in ECV might be associated with the
            severity of ventricular hypertrophy.
Several segmentation approaches are used to quantify the ECV in clinical
            settings, including the entire LV myocardium, the septal myocardium and ROI in the
            noninfarcted myocardial region
            8.
            Since CMR-derived ECV values may vary with myocardial region, it is
            essential to evaluate whether the position of the ROI affects the ability to
            differentiate myocardial abnormalities. In this study, we used ROC analysis to assess
            the diagnostic power of ECV measurements from each region and from the whole region of
            myocardium. Our results showed that the diagnostic power using regional ECV measured
            from the septal, posterior and lateral regions was similar to that measured from the
            whole region. This finding suggested that the ECV measurements from these regions can
            feasibly differentiate the myocardial abnormalities compared with the measurements from
            the whole myocardium. Our findings also indicated that ECV measurements from the
            anterior region had lower distinguishing power than the other regions. In this cohort,
            the SD was 0.82% for the ECV abnormality cut-off values in each myocardial region. For
            the intra- and interobserver variability tests, the bias SDs were 1.048% and 1.184%,
            respectively. Therefore, regional ECV variations did not lead to reclassification of the
            myocardial region being normal or abnormal, and no need to define the various cut-off
            values depending on myocardial regions.
CMR-derived ECV can be evaluated using the ROI-based method either from
            native and postcontrast T1 maps or directly from ECV mapping
            6.
            In this study, we demonstrated that CMR-derived ECV measurements had
            significant interregional variation in both the control and patient groups. These
            variations were positively associated with the regional wall thickness. Therefore,
            caution must be exercised in estimating the ECV in patients with significant ventricular
            hypertrophy. The position of the ROI should be obtained in the same region or should
            cover the entire LV myocardium. In addition, our results showed that there was no
            significant difference in the ECVs from these five different sized ROIs. Nonetheless, we
            noted that the SD of the ECV within the ROI was lower in larger ROIs than in smaller
            ROIs. This finding may imply that one should select as large an ROI as possible without
            including ventricular blood and papillary muscle.
There are several limitations to this study. First, our study was done
            with a single T1 pulse sequence (MOLLI). Different sequences of T1 mapping have been
            reported to yield different absolute ECV values
            18.
            The inter-ECV results were based on the relative difference in ECV among
            the four regions. Whether this variation is identical in different pulse sequences is
            unknown and needs further investigation. Second, our results indicated that the control
            group had two regional variations in ECV compared with four in the patient group
               (Fig. 2). The control group was smaller than
            the patient group, which may have limited our ability to detect subtle differences
            between regions. Whether the results of this study were merely a matter of sample size
            remains unknown. Nonetheless, there appears to be the same tendency of septal ECV being
            larger than the other regional ECVs in all groups. Third, although all subjects were
            carefully controlled in data acquisition and analysis, our results do not have
            histological evidence to support the suggestion that this interregional variation of ECV
            reflects a pathophysiological difference rather than a technical difference. Forth,
            regional variation of ECV was only performed in one representative mid-ventricular
            slice, future studies should consider apical and basal slices for more comprehensive
            assessments.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CMR-derived ECVs vary with
            myocardial region in both the patient and control groups. This interregional variation
            is associated with the severity of ventricular hypertrophy. Regional ECV is feasible for
            differentiating myocardial abnormalities compared with ECV derived from the whole region
            except for in the anterior region. When conducting ECV measurements using the ROI-based
            method, the position of the ROI is essential for comparing ROIs within the same region,
            but the measured size of the ROI is less critical to consistencies in ECV
            measurement.
