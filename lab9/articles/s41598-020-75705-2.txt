Automated synthesis and preliminary evaluation of [18F]FDPA for cardiac inflammation imaging in rats after myocardial infarction
A translocator protein 18 kDa targeted radiotracer, N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-[18F]fluorophenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-3-yl) acetamide ([18F]FDPA), was automated synthetized and evaluated for cardiac inflammation imaging. Various reaction conditions for an automated synthesis were systematically optimized. MicroPET/CT imaging were performed on normal rats and rats with myocardial infarction (MI). Normalized SUV ratios of [18F]FDPA to [13N]NH3 (NSRs) in different regions were calculated to normalize the uptake of [18F]FDPA to perfusion. The amount of TBAOMs and the volume/proportion of water were crucial for synthesis. After optimization, the total synthesis time was 68 min. The non-decay corrected radiochemical yields (RCYs) and molar activities were 19.9 ± 1.7% and 169.7 ± 46.5 GBq/μmol, respectively. In normal rats, [18F]FDPA showed a high and stable cardiac uptake and fast clearance from other organs. In MI rats, NSRs in the peri-infarct and infarct regions, which were infiltrated with massive inflammatory cells revealed by pathology, were higher than that in the remote region (1.20 ± 0.01 and 1.08 ± 0.10 vs. 0.89 ± 0.05, respectively). [18F]FDPA was automated synthesized with high RCYs and molar activities. It showed a high uptake in inflammation regions and offered a wide time window for cardiac imaging, indicating it could be a potential cardiac inflammation imaging agent.
Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is mainly localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is associated with various biological processes such as controlling the translocation of cholesterol, regulating mitochondrial membrane potential, mediating immune response, modulating voltage dependent calcium channels and apoptosis1. Since it is overexpressed in the activated microglia, the TSPO targeted imaging was focused on evaluating neuroinflammation in the past, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and dementia2,3,4.




Mitochondria take up 20–30% of the myocardial intracellular volume5, making TSPO an attractive biomarker for the diagnosis and evaluation the treatment effects of cardiac diseases6,7,8. Inflammation plays an important role in the healing process after myocardial ischemia9. Some clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs have been performed on patients with acute myocardial ischemia10,11. TSPO is also involved in cardiac inflammation related to macrophage infiltration12. Therefore, it might be used to monitor inflammatory response, facilitating physicians to choose the appropriate patients and right time for intervention. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive technology to monitor functional and physiological changes in vivo. Currently, several studies reported that TSPO PET imaging could assess cardiac inflammation, such as myocarditis13,14 and inflammation after ischemia15, making it a “hot target” for cardiac inflammation imaging.
N,N-Diethyl-2-(2-(4-[18F]fluorophenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]FDPA) was reported as a TSPO ligand with an excellent binding affinity (Ki = 2 nM) and a good metabolic stability16,17. But the difficulty in fluorine-18 labeling limited its further application. The radiofluorination reaction via [18F]fluoride reported in 2015 resulted in low radiochemical conversions (RCCs, < 3%)17. Olof Solin, et al. started with carrier-added [18F]F2 to prepare [18F]FDPA. The decay corrected radiochemical yields (RCYs) were increased to 15 ± 3%, but the molar activities were still not satisfied (7.8 ± 0.5 GBq/μmol)18. In 2017, Lu Wang, et al. used the adamantyl auxiliary-based precursor 2-(2-(4-(((1r,3r,5r,7r)-4′,6′-dioxospiro[adamantane-2,2′-[1,3]dioxan]-5′-ylidene)-λ3-iodaneyl)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)-N,N-diethylacetamide (DPA-SPIAD) to manually prepare [18F]FDPA, and dramatically improved both decay corrected RCYs (45 ± 8%) and molar activities (96 ± 22 GBq/μmol)19, making the further evaluation of [18F]FDPA possible.
In this report, we optimized an automated synthesis of [18F]FDPA based on the previously reported spirocyclic iodonium ylide method19, and were first to evaluate [18F]FDPA for myocardial inflammation imaging.
As shown in Table 1, when the proportion of water decreased, the elution efficiency decreased remarkably (No.1 vs. No.2, No.3 vs. No.5). Similarly, the stock solution with more volume of water resulted in higher elution efficiency (No.2 vs. No.4, No.7 vs. No.8). On the other hand, more amounts of TBAOMs could improve the elution efficiency as well (No.4 vs. No.6 & No.8). According to Table 1, the best formulation of stock solution was 20 mg TBAOMs in 0.4 mL H2O and 0.4 mL CH3CN.
Both reaction temperature and time affected RCC (Table 2). The best condition for labeling was heating at 100 °C for 15 min. When the temperature increased to 120 °C, or the reaction time extended to 20 min, RCC reduced dramatically.
[18F]FDPA could be adsorbed by some sterile filters, leading to low RCYs. In this study, the adsorption rates of Mtllex-GS, Minisart and Cathivex-GV were 96.3 ± 0.02%, 25.4 ± 0.01% and 3.4 ± 0.01%, respectively (n = 3). Cathivex-GV sterile filter was suitable for [18F]FDPA.
The optimal synthesis process was described above. Starting from [18F]fluoride trapped on a QMA cartridge, the total synthesis time was 68 min, including HPLC purification and formulation. The RCYs were 19.9 ± 1.7% (n = 3) without correction. The radio-HPLC retention time of [18F]FDPA (tR = 13.3 min) was consistent with the corresponding nonradioactive reference (tR = 12.7 min) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The RCPs ≥ 99%. The molar activities were 169.7 ± 46.5 GBq/μmol (4.6 ± 1.2 Ci/μmol) at the end of synthesis.
In normal rats, TACs indicated that [18F]FDPA mainly accumulated in the heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys and intestines, in which TSPO were highly expressed (Fig. 3). The initial uptake in lungs were too high that the observation of the heart was interfered. Fortunately, the clearance of [18F]FDPA from lungs was fast. At 20–55 min p.i., the heart showed stable and prominent uptake of [18F]FDPA. The SUVs in the heart were 7.15 ± 0.66 at 20 min and 6.99 ± 0.49 at 55 min p.i. respectively, higher than other organs nearby (Fig. 3). Other tissues in which TSPO were barely expressed, such as muscle (SUVs were 0.63 ± 0.11 at 20 min and 0.62 ± 0.01 at 55 min p.i., respectively), exhibited low uptake of [18F]FDPA.

In the [13N]NH3 images of MI rats (Fig. 4), a severe perfusion defect with significantly reduced [13N]NH3 activity was observed in the apex and anterior wall. In [18F]FDG images, the extent of reduced [18F]FDG uptake was smaller than that in [13N]NH3 images. As shown in Fig. 5, [18F]FDPA was accumulated obviously in peri-infarct region, compared with that in remote region or infarct region at 5–55 min p.i. From 25–55 min p.i., the SUVs in peri-infarct regions were maintained consistently, without significant difference (F = 0.064, P = 0.977), as well as the SUVs in remote regions (F = 0.184, P = 0.904) or infarct regions (F = 0.220, P = 0.880) (Fig. 5). At 35 min p.i., the NSRs in the peri-infarct, infarct and remote regions were 1.20 ± 0.01, 1.08 ± 0.10 and 0.89 ± 0.05, respectively (P = 0.027). The NSRs in the peri-infarct, infarct regions were higher than that in remote regions (P = 0.022 and 0.539, respectively). In the blocking study, the uptake of [18F]FDPA was obviously inhibited by PK11195 (Supplementary Fig. 2), which confirmed the affinity of [18F]FDPA to TSPO.

As shown in Fig. 6, abundant dark purple stains accumulated in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, indicating these regions were infiltrated by inflammatory cells. In contrast, there was few dark purple stains in the remote myocardium.

[18F]FDPA is an analog of a well-known TSPO ligand 18F-DPA-71421,22. The aryl-18F bond of [18F]FDPA successfully improved the metabolic stability18,23, but also brought a challenge for fluorine-18 labeling. Compared with the manual method19, the current study optimized a series of parameters and developed an automated synthesis of [18F]FDPA with better RCC (74.6% vs. 63%), higher molar activities (169.7 ± 46.5 vs. 96 ± 22 GBq/μmol), shorter synthesis time (68 min vs 80 min) and comparable RCYs and RCPs19. Compared with the automated method reported recently24, the process resulted in better RCYs (19.9 ± 1.7% vs. 15.6 ± 4.2%).
In this study, several key points affected the final radiochemical yield from the automated synthesis using this method. Firstly, the amount of TBAOMs and the volume/proportion of water for [18F]fluoride elution was crucial to achieving higher RCC and molar activity. Though both the increase of volume or proportion of water can rise elution efficiency, the incremental water may also affect the drying efficiency in the next step. Therefore, we optimized the formulation of stock solution as 20 mg TBAOMs in 0.4 mL CH3CN and 0.4 mL H2O, instead of the previous method (12 mg TBAOMs in 0.5 mL CH3CN and 0.5 mL H2O), and resulted in a satisfied elution efficiency. This formulation of stock solution could be a reference for other automated fluorine-18 labeling with TBAOMs. Secondly, the reaction temperature and time also affected the RCC as reported before19. In CFN-MPS200 module, the best reaction temperature and time was 100 °C for 15 min. If the reaction time was prolonged or the temperature was increased, RCC decreased accordingly. This may due to the complete evaporation of CH3CN under those harsher conditions, which could be observed from the camera of CFN-MPS200 module, leading to no liquid medium available for the reaction. Thirdly, some sterile filters can adversely affect the final radiochemical yield by adsorbing [18F]FDPA onto the specific filter membranes preventing the quantitative transfer of radioactivity into the final sterile vial.
In the respective PET imaging studies, the absence of radioactivity uptake in the affected MI regions of both [13N]NH3 and [18F]FDG images indicated the MI models were successfully made. Low uptake of [18F]FDPA in the liver and the fast clearance from lungs resulted in an improved quality image indicating specific cardiac inflammation when compared to other cardiac inflammation imaging tracers, such as [125I]IodoDPA-71313, 18F-CB25114, and 68Ga-NOTA-MSA25. The stable uptake of [18F]FDPA in the peri-infarct, infarct and remote regions offered a wider time window for cardiac imaging. The higher NSRs in the peri-infarct and infarct regions compared with that in the remote regions, combined with the result of H&E staining indicated that [18F]FDPA can be accumulated in the inflammation lesions of the heart in MI model.
[18F]FDG is used in clinic for cardiac inflammation imaging. However, the high uptake of [18F]FDG by cardiomyocytes seriously interfere with inflammation imaging. Dietary strategies or unfractionated heparin administration is required for the suppression of the uptake by viable or normal myocytes26. A similar phenomenon is observed in this study. Since TSPO was highly expressed in normal cardiomyocytes12, [18F]FDPA showed certain uptake in normal myocardium, which might complicate the results of cardiac inflammation imaging. Besides that, in the infarct region, due to the dysfunction of mitochondria in cardiomyocyte15, the SUVs of [18F]FDPA were not as high as that in remote regions, which affected the visual analysis of inflammation. Therefore, the images of TSPO targeted tracers need an appropriate normalization method for cardiac inflammation imaging. Frank M. Bengel et al. used the polar map of 99mTc-sestamibi as a reference, successfully assessed the elevated signal of a TSPO tracer 18F-GE180 in the infarct region of mice at 1 week post MI15. In this study, we used the activity of [13N]NH3 as a reference, calculated the NSRs in the peri-infarct, infarct and remote regions.
TSPO is associated with various cardiac diseases, such as arrhythmia27, large vessel vasculitis28, cardiac hypertrophy29, atherosclerosis30 and myocarditis14. It is worth mentioning that, TSPO is not only a diagnostic marker, but also a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases12. TSPO ligands have been studied as therapeutic drugs for cardiovascular diseases, including arrhythmia27 and MI31. Therefore, the quantitative determination of TSPO level by TSPO targeted tracers may offer more valuable information for individual treatment strategy and curative effects. Besides that, since TSPO targeted tracers are prominent for neuroinflammatory imaging, whole-body TSPO imaging may be used to evaluate the systemic inflammatory response in certain diseases. TSPO targeted tracers are worth further investigations. At the meantime, follow-up studies, especially with suitable methods for analysis, are warranted in the future.
