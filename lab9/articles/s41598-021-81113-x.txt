Hsa-miR-494-3p attenuates gene HtrA3 transcription to increase inflammatory response in hypoxia/reoxygenation HK2 Cells
The occurrence of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) increases hospital stay and mortality. MicroRNAs has a crucial role in AKI. This objective of the current study is to explore the function of hsa-miR-494-3p in inflammatory response in human kidney tubular epithelial (HK2) cells with hypoxia/reoxygenation. According to KDIGO standard, patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were divided into two groups: AKI (n = 10) and non-AKI patients (n = 8). HK2 were raised in the normal and hypoxia/reoxygenation circumstances and mainly treated by overexpression ofmiR-494-3p and HtrA3. The relationship between miR-494-3p and HtrA3 was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our result showed that Hsa-miR-494-3p was elevated in the serum of patients with CSA-AKI, and also induced in hypoxic reoxygenated HK2 cells. Hsa-miR-494-3p also increased a hypoxia-reoxygenation induced inflammatory response in HK2 cells. Moreover, as a target gene of miR-494-3p, overexpression of HtrA3 downregulated the hypoxia-reoxygenation induced inflammatory response in HK2 cells. Overexpression of hsa-miR-494-3p-induced inflammatory response was inhibited by overexpression of HtrA3. Collectively, we identified that hsa-miR-494-3p, a miRNA induced in both circulation of AKI patients and hypoxia-reoxygenation-treated HK2 cells, enhanced renal inflammation by targeting HtrA3, which may suggest a possible role as a new therapeutic target for CSA-AKI.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of hospitalized patients, which results in oliguria, anuria and elevated creatinine, and apparently increases the mortality of hospitalized patients1,2,3. Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the second most common cause of AKI after sepsis4. At present, CPB is considered to be the main cause of AKI after cardiac surgery, and ischemia–reperfusion injury is considered the main pathway of CPB associated-kidney injury5,6,7,8. Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) patients are the ideal AKI study population because the time of damage is known, and CPB provides a non-physiological condition of ischemia and hypothermia, it is a high risk factor for kidney damage.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with a length of about 20–24 nucleotides. By binding to the 3′-non-coding region of targeted mRNA9, miRNAs inhibit the translation of targeted proteins and achieve negative regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level10. MiRNAs is the most frequently studied non-coding RNA for AKI11. Current studies on animal models and some types of AKI, such as AKI after ischemia–reperfusion injury12, kidney transplantation13 and application of nephrotoxic drugs14, have accumulated evidence that a variety of miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of AK15,16,17, showing its potential clinical value, providing a new way to study the molecular mechanism of CSA-AKI. MicroRNAs of CSA-AKI is secreted into circulation or urine, so can be used as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers to study the occurrence, development and prognosis of CSA-AKI18. The study on upregulation of miR-494 has been identified as an oncogenic miRNA and is associated with poor prognosis in several types of human cancer19,20,21. However, miR-494 is found downregulated and suppressed cell proliferation in some cancer cells22,23,24. At present, upregulation of hsa-miR-494-3p promotes acute kidney injury by negatively regulating ATF3 protein synthesis, because ATF3 plays a protective role in renal ischemia–reperfusion injury25. However, the network regulation of hsa-miR-494-3p on renal injury is the same complex as on cancer. It is unclear whether hsa-miR-494-3p affects the severity of kidney injury by regulating other proteins, so we try to further study hsa-miR-494-3p on this point.
According to KDIGO standard26 [serum creatinine increased by more than 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mmol/L) within 48 h after cardiac surgery or more than 1.5 times higher than the preoperative baseline within 7 days after cardiac surgery]26, patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were divided into two groups: AKI and non-AKI patients (Fig. 1A). The changes of serum creatinine during perioperative period between the two groups were shown in Fig. 1B. The onset time of CSA-AKI was concentrated between the first day and the third day after operation. The serum creatinine of AKI patients in this study all recovered to the normal level around seven days after operation. Hsa-miR-494-3p in the serum of patients with CSA-AKI is elevated significantly at an hour after back into ICU, and returns to its baseline level at 12 h after back into ICU (Fig. 1C).

We use the public prediction platform (TargetScan Release 7.2, URL: http://www.targetscan.org/) and MicroRNA Target Prediction Database (miRDB, URL: http://mirdb.org/) to search 3′-UTR of HtrA3 which maybe a potential target of miR-494-3p. The expression of miR-494-3p went up significantly induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation, compared to the control group (Fig. 2A), and hypoxia/reoxygenation also induced KIM-1 up (Fig. 2B). However, the expression of HtrA3 in the hypoxia-reoxygenation HK2 cells was significantly lower than that in the control group (Fig. 2C,D). We overexpressed miR-494-3p by transfecting HK2 cells with miR-494-3p mimics (Fig. 3A). Overexpression miR-494-3p further decreased HtrA3 protein level inhibited by hypoxia/reoxygenation (Fig. 3B,C), and further increased ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory response in HK2 cells. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 increased after treatment of miR-494-3p mimics (Fig. 4A,B).

A kind of miRNAs can regulate the translation of various protein mRNAs. At present, the negative regulation mechanism of hsa-miR-494-3p on transcription factor 3 (ATF-3, a protein that protects kidney against stress response) protein synthesis has been clearly studied. miR-494-3p can be detected in renal tissue and urine, and it is upregulated during ischemia–reperfusion injury, which significantly inhibits the activation of ATF3, thus promoting the production of inflammatory mediators IL-6, MCP-1 and P-selectin in AKI model. Transfection of antisense miR-494-3p into mice improved renal injury induced by ischemia–reperfusion, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the apoptotic activity of caspase-3. This study also laid a solid foundation for the pathophysiological role of miR-494-3p in AKI model25. The study on cyclosporine (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity showed kidney injury in mice was associated with an early increase in expression of miR-494, and it also explored tubular epithelial cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by CsA toxicity resulted in the upregulation of miR-494 and a decrease in PTEN levels in vitro. miR-494 directly targeted Pten and negatively regulated its expression27.
In addition to targeting protein ATF3 and PTEN, our data show hsa-miR-494-3p attenuates gene HtrA3 transcription to increase inflammatory response in hypoxia/reoxygenation HK2. Like ATF3, HtrA3 proteins also play a protective role in ischemia–reperfusion kidney injury. The expression of HtrA3 protein may inhibit inflammatory response through nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway which promotes renal inflammation, apoptosis and renal damage. The human HtrA family of ATP independent serine proteases (HtrA1, HtrA2, HtrA3, and HtrA4) are the key enzymes associated with pregnancy and closely related to the development and progression of many pathological events28,29, and they promote cell death in stress conditions and play a role as tumor suppressors. HtrA3 is a trimeric PDZ bearing propapoptotic serine protease, which is also involved in various diseases including pre-eclampsia and cancer30. A recent study on Endometrial cancer demonstrated hypoxia reduced the content of HtrA3, and silencing HtrA3 promoted Endometrial cancer cell migration, and as the degree of hypoxia increases in Endometrial cancer. Hypoxia leads to a decrease in HtrA3, which may promote cancer progression. These results indicated that HtrA3 plays an adaptive role in endometrial cancer in anoxic regions31. The human HtrA3 protease is involved in development and progress of many physiological events, including placentation, stimulation of apoptosis and considered as a tumor suppressor. The molecular mechanism of HtrA3’s function is unclear now, and knowledge of its cellular targets is limited32. Our study is the first to explore the role of HtrA3 in renal inflammation. It also explained that HtrA3 can reduce the renal inflammatory response induced by hsa-miR-494-3p, but cannot completely block or even reverse the kidney injury. So our results also suggested that hsa-miR-494-3p may play a complex network regulatory role in kidney injury (Supplementary information).
Studies have shown that urinary levels of miR-494-3p in AKI patients in comprehensive ICU increased before changes in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen25; however, there was no difference in serum samples, and their causes of AKI in the comprehensive ICU were inconsistent. Our study showed hsa-miR-494-3p is elevated in serum of CSA-AKI patients. Because some patients may have no urine in clinic, we did not test hsa-miR-494-3p in urine samples. However, the difference between these two studies in the detection of miR-494-3p in serum may be related to the time of kidney injury, and may also be related to prognosis. The pathogenesis of CSA-AKI is not clear6, and there are no effective preventive and therapeutic measures. At present, the indicators representing the loss of renal function cannot timely diagnose the occurrence of AKI. Because miRNAs regulated transcription of proteins, miRNAs should be more sensitive and earlier to be detected, compared with proteins, for example SCr, and miR-494-3p rose for 1 h after the surgery and returned to its baseline level at 12 h after the surgery. So hsa-miR-494-3p can be used as a molecular biological marker for early diagnosis of CSA-AKI patients. Hsa-miR-494-3p may participate in the early stage of the occurrence of CSA-AKI, and may also predict a good prognosis of CSA-AKI.
We showed that miR-494-3p was induced in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury which indicated AKI following ischemia–reperfusion injury. MiR-494-3p directly bound to 3′-UTR of HtrA3, which increased an anoxia-reperfusion induced inflammatory response. The expression of HtrA3 protein may inhibit inflammatory response through NF-kappa B signaling pathway. According to our knowledge, this is the first study that showed miR-494-3p also can increase renal inflammation by downregulation of HtrA3. The limitation of this study is just showing human miR-494-3p bound with the 3′-UTR of HtrA3, and lacking the protective role of HtrA3 on animal models of AKI. Collectively, Hsa-miR-494-3p may be used as an early diagnostic marker and a good prognostic predictor of CSA-AKI, and miR-494-3p/HtrA3 axis may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CSA-AKI.
